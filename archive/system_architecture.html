<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document sets out a system architecture for a deployment of the security service as part of a
complete system where it can be used by client applications. This system architecture is constructed
around an example deployment where the applications are running in containers within a shared
operating system kernel (without full virtualisation). This is not the only possible deployment
pattern, and many of the concepts in this document could be adapted to suit other deployments.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The security service provides an API to key storage and cryptographic operations. This API is based
on the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto API
Specification</strong></a>.
The API is exposed to clients over a transport medium using a <a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a>, so that it can be consumed by client applications in
multiple programming languages, residing in separate processes on the shared physical host. The
security service is a <strong>multi-tenant</strong> service. It isolates and partitions the key store such that
secure assets provisioned by one client application cannot be used by another. This isolation can
only be achieved if every client application is able to present a unique and stable identity to the
security service. This identity also has to be validated on the host system, so that client
applications can prove their identity and therefore authenticate themselves to use the security
service.</p>
<p>The distribution and validation of client identitites is a vital part of the overall deployment of
the system. This system architecture sets out one possible way in which this can be achieved
end-to-end.</p>
<p>The goal of this or any system architecture is to show how any client application can call an
individual cryptographic operation, such that the security service can not only trust the source of
the call, but also perform it with the required degree of isolation from other clients.</p>
<p>Isolation is based on the critical concept of an <strong>application identity</strong>. An application identity
is a canonical string value, akin to a namespace, which is used to partition all storage (whether
persistent or ephemeral) and all activities within the security service. Application identities are
unique per client application. They are stable across application restarts, system restarts, and
component upgrades.</p>
<p>The system architecture enables each client application to pass its application identity to the
security service in a way that is cryptographically proven end-to-end. This allows the security
service to trust the caller's identity, and to implement the required isolation. The architecture
achieves this by placing the security service alongside some additional components that understand
the client application lifecycle and are able to both provide and prove the identity string for each
client.</p>
<p>The system architecture document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of <strong>design goals</strong> is established to act as guiding principles and constraints for the
architecture.</li>
<li>The <strong>participating components</strong> are listed along with a definition of their roles within the
system. Note that the security service is the only component whose implementation is contained in
this source code repository. Additional components are implemented separately. This document only
sets out the required roles and contracts of those additional components. Their precise
implementation can depend on the deployment.</li>
<li>The <strong>trust relationships</strong> are described in terms of how they are established and maintained, and
also in terms of which components share such relationships.</li>
<li>The <strong>trusted data payloads</strong> are described. These are the data objects that are subject to
cryptographic signing and verification according to the defined trust relationships.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>flows</strong> of data between components are captured in a sequence diagram, which shows
how the system is bootstrapped and then used on an ongoing basis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-goals"><a class="header" href="#design-goals">Design Goals</a></h2>
<p>The system architecture aims to address the following design goals and constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system should be <strong>fault tolerant</strong> in general, but specifically with respect to any transient
loss or restart of any of the participating components. If one component restarts, then other
components should be able to recover their ability to communicate with it, such that there is no
loss of functionality across the system as a whole. It is acceptable for sub-optimal performance
to be incurred for a transient period during recovery.</li>
<li>Communication channels should be <strong>stateless</strong>. This is partly to address the fault-tolerance
requirement set out above, but also because it is generally considered to be good practice in
service-oriented architectures of which this system is an example. The participating components
will necessarily have their own internal state where needed, both persistent and ephemeral. The
security service, for example, has at least one store for secure assets (such as keys). But
components should not rely on shared state without an ability to re-synchronize that state at
arbitrary times.</li>
<li>Communication channels should be <strong>secretless</strong>. Passing private keys or other secrets across wire
protocol interfaces is forbidden. Only public keys or other non-confidential assets can be
passed.</li>
<li>Components should store any secret data <strong>in local process memory only</strong>, unless there is an
overriding requirement for it to be stored persistently. Trust relationships between components
need to be re-established (by sharing the public part of a new key pair) in the case where a
component is restarted.</li>
<li>The system should be <strong>cryptographically secure</strong>. A cryptographically-provable mechanism must
exist in the communication channels between components.</li>
<li>Cryptographic security should be established on a <strong>short-lived</strong> basis. Trust between components
must be refreshed periodically.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="participating-components-and-their-roles"><a class="header" href="#participating-components-and-their-roles">Participating Components and their Roles</a></h2>
<p>The system architecture defines the following participating components, all of which are assumed to
co-reside on the same physical host:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>client application</strong> is the ultimate consumer of the security API. Any number of client
applications can share the same physical host. They can be written in different programming
languages, and reside across multiple containers or processes. The functionality of each client
application is arbitrary, and the only thing that they have in common is their shared requirement
to access the cryptographic services of the host platform. Client applications should not be
confused with processes or containers. It is possible for a single client application to be
spread across multiple processes or containers. Conversely, it is possible for a single process
or container to house multiple client applications. The boundary between client applications is a
security boundary that is defined and arbitrated by other components in the system.</li>
<li>The <strong>client library</strong> is a convenience layer that provides a simplified and idiomatic way to
access the security API in a specific programming language. The client library is loaded by the
client application and shares its address space. Communications between the client application
and the client library are in-process and in-language procedure calls with no IPC. There is one
client library per supported programming language. Client libraries are more than just bindings.
Each one offers a highly-designed developer experience tailored to the programming language,
providing the API in a form that is simple to consume and hard to get wrong. This means that it
has facilities for things like smart defaulting, so that the client application can call APIs
with fewer arguments and simplified contracts that are tailored for specific use cases. The
client library is then fundamentally an adapter or wrapper: it converts between the simplified
developer experience and the comprehensive API definition based on the PSA Crypto API. It makes
calls to the security service according to the defined <a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol
specification</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>orchestrator</strong> is the component that manages the lifecycle of the client applications on the
physical host. It is responsible for starting and stopping their containers or processes. In a
containerized environment on a Linux system, a daemon such as
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/"><strong>dockerd</strong></a> would naturally
assume the role of the orchestrator in this system architecture. A single instance of the
orchestrator runs on the host system.</li>
<li>The <strong>security service</strong> is the component that provides the API to the cryptographic services of
the host platform. This API is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto API
Specification</strong></a>.
A single instance of this service runs on the host system (deployed, for example, as a daemon).
It listens on a suitable host-local transport medium such as a Unix domain socket and exposes a
<a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol</strong></a> with a <a href="../parsec_client/api_overview.html"><strong>defined
API</strong></a>. The inner architecture of the service is described in
the other documents in this repository.</li>
<li>The <strong>identity provider</strong> is the component that assigns unique and stable application identities
to each client application. Any string that can be used persistently and unambiguously to refer
to one and only one client application is suitable. This system architecture proposes the use of
a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as the identity scheme used by
<a href="https://spiffe.io"><strong>SPIFFE</strong></a>. The identity provider receives application lifecycle events from
the orchestrator, and these events contain enough information for the identity provider to deduce
the application identity and return it to client applications on request. The identity provider
is fundamentally a mapping service, with orchestrator data as its input and application
identities as its output. The identity provider exposes the same <a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a> as the security service, albeit with a different
set of APIs to reflect its very different role.</li>
<li>The <strong>crypto provider</strong> is a back-end software module within the security service that interfaces
with the hardware or software facilities of the platform in order to implement key storage and
cryptographic operations. Within the service itself, these modules are simply called &quot;providers&quot;,
but the term &quot;crypto provider&quot; is used here to avoid confusion with the identity provider
component. Crypto providers provide access to hardware facilities such as Trusted Platform
Modules (TPMs) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Alternatively, they might interact with
software components running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or secure enclave, if the
host platform supports them. Their implementations would vary considerably depending on the
platforms, and these details are largely irrelevant to the system architecture. They are included
here largely for completeness, since they are the ultimate provider of the cryptographic services
being consumed by the client applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trust-relationships"><a class="header" href="#trust-relationships">Trust Relationships</a></h2>
<p>This section outlines the trust relationships that exist between components, how they are
established, and how they are maintained over the component lifetimes. This section covers only
those trust relationships that are material to the system architecture: other trust relationships
might exist in the system for various reasons.</p>
<p>The trust relationships detailed below are always established between pairs of components: the
<strong>trusted component</strong> and the <strong>trusting component</strong>. They are based on <strong>asymmetric digital
signatures</strong>. They rely on trusted component being able to sign some data such that the trusting
component can verify it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The trusted component generates a <strong>root key-pair</strong>.</li>
<li>The trusted component maintains the <strong>root private key</strong> in process-local memory only. The private
key is not shared with any other component, nor is it stored persistently.</li>
<li>The trusted component sends the <strong>root public key</strong> to the trusting component as an X509
certificate. This is done by making an API call according to the conventions of the <a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol specification</strong></a>. This is strictly a one-time
operation, and this must be enforced by the trusting component. Any attempt to send revised root
keys must be rejected. For more information, refer to the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> operation in the
API reference.</li>
<li>On a periodic basis, the trusted component generates a new <strong>intermediate key pair</strong>, and once
again keeps the private key in process-local memory only.</li>
<li>On each periodic refresh, the trusted component sends a new <strong>intermediate public key</strong> to the
trusting component, again as an X509 certificate. (This allows the trusting component to view the
intermediate certificate and the root certificate as a chain).</li>
<li>In general communication, the trusted component will use its private key to sign data, and the
trusting component will use the public certificate chain to verify it. If verification passes,
then the data can be trusted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &quot;root&quot; here should be qualified, since any root key or certificate is only a root from the
perspective of this system architecture. This does not exclude the possibility that these roots are
themselves part of a longer trust chain involving an external Certificate Authority (CA).
Integrations with external CAs are outside of the scope of this document. The term &quot;root&quot; should
always be considered with this qualification in mind.</p>
<p>In this system architecture, two trust relationships exist, each of which is established and
maintained according to the scheme described above. The trust relationships are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the <strong>orchestrator</strong> and the <strong>identity provider</strong>. In this case, the orchestrator is the
trusted component and the identity provider is the trusting component. The need for a trust
relationship here is due to the orchestrator being a presenter of client definitions and proofs
to the identity provider.</li>
<li>Between the <strong>identity provider</strong> and the <strong>security service</strong>. In this case, the identity
provider is the trusted component and the security service is the trusting component. The need
for this trust relationship is to allow the identity provider to sign authentication tokens on
behalf of each client, such that the security service can verify those tokens and permit an API
call to proceed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wire-protocols"><a class="header" href="#wire-protocols">Wire Protocols</a></h2>
<p>Both the identity provider and the security service expose an API endpoint based on the common
<a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a>. However, the roles of these
two components are very different, and it follows that the set of API operations offered by each
endpoint will be likewise different. In the case of the security service, the majority of its API
operations are for key storage and cryptography, and are based on the PSA Crypto API. In the case of
the identity provider, a much smaller set of operations are needed, and these enable the sharing of
client definitions and proofs.</p>
<p>The only part of the API that is common between the two components is the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong>
operation, which is used to establish and maintain trust relationships.</p>
<p>The identity provider additionally offers the <strong>AddClient</strong> and <strong>ProveClient</strong> operations, which
allow the orchestrator to inform the identity provider about the lifecycle of client applications.
This small operation set represents the entirety of the identity provider's API.</p>
<p>By contrast, the security service exposes the full capabilities of the PSA Crypto API.</p>
<h2 id="trusted-data-payloads"><a class="header" href="#trusted-data-payloads">Trusted Data Payloads</a></h2>
<p>A trusted data payload is any data payload that is signed and verified according to one of the
defined trust relationships. Since two trust relationships are defined in this system architecture,
it follows that a trusted data payload is either a payload that is signed by the orchestrator and
verified by the identity provider, or it is a payload that is signed by the identity provider and
verified by the security service. This section outlines the trusted data payloads that are subject
to such sign-and-verify procedures.</p>
<h3 id="client-definitions"><a class="header" href="#client-definitions">Client Definitions</a></h3>
<p>The system architecture requires each client application to have an identity that is unique and
stable. This requirement for stability is especially important given that many low-level
characteristics of a client application may change over time. Process identifiers, for example, can
change as a client application restarts. Even the contents of a client application image can change
due to an upgrade. So a client application needs to be able to present enough pieces of information
to the identity provider in order for the identify provider to make a binding decision about the
identity.</p>
<p>These pieces of information are collected together into what is called a <strong>client definition</strong>.</p>
<p>There can be no fixed set of properties that would make an adequate client definition in any
environment. The system architecture only requires that the orchestrator and the identity provider
are able to agree on what the client definition should be. Client definition is essentially a
contract between those two components. An example of a client definition might be a JSON document
containing properties such as the container image identifier, host identifier and kernel namespace.</p>
<p>Client definition formats are agreed between the orchestrator and the identity provider on any given
system. A JSON or similar structure would be typical. The client definition is constructed by the
orchestrator, and notified to the identity provider at key lifecycle points such as client start-up
or shut-down. (More details are given in the section on dataflows below).</p>
<p>Client definitions, regardless of their precise format and content, must be signed by the
orchestrator and verified upon receipt by the identity provider. The orchestrator will use its own
private key for signing, and verification will be via the shared public key. See the section above
on trust relationships for details of how these keys are generated and shared.</p>
<h3 id="client-proofs"><a class="header" href="#client-proofs">Client Proofs</a></h3>
<p>A client definition is essentially a set of claims. By presenting a client definition, the client
application is asserting its worthiness to be assigned a particular identity string by the identity
provider. In order for these claims to be made valid inputs to the mapping process, the identity
provider needs to be able to trust them. They cannot simply be asserted. They must also be
<strong>proved</strong>. Proofs are obtained through an attestation process, the precise details of which are
beyond the scope of this document, but illustrative examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply-chain proofs, such as an image signature or signatures on component binaries.</li>
<li>Host proofs, such as might be derived from a platform root-of-trust.</li>
<li>Runtime proofs, such as process identifiers, user/group identifiers, kernel namespaces or
application-specific key pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with client definitions, client proofs must be signed by the orchestrator and verified upon
receipt by the identity provider. The orchestrator will use its own private key for signing, and
verification will be via the shared public key. See the section above on trust relationships for
details of how these keys are generated and shared.</p>
<h3 id="authentication"><a class="header" href="#authentication">Authentication</a></h3>
<h4 id="authentication-tokens"><a class="header" href="#authentication-tokens">Authentication Tokens</a></h4>
<p>When client applications invoke API operations in the security service, they must include their
application identity string somehow. This allows the security service to provide the required level
of isolation amongst the multiple clients that might exist. Not only must the identity string be
specified, but it must be specified in a way that allows the security service to be sure that it is
genuine. Client applications do this by means of an <strong>authentication token</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> has an <strong>authentication
header</strong> field that is suited to this purpose. The protocol is very flexible, and the authentication
header can be used in a variety of ways. It would be entirely possible for the client application to
simply pass its application identity directly as a cleartext string. The security service would
support this (and it offers an authentication style known as <strong>direct authentication</strong> for this
purpose). This is simple, and works well in a demo or proof-of-concept environment. But it is not
suitable for a deployed system architecture, because it does not fulfill the stated design goal of
secretless communication.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is for the authentication header to contain a payload that not only
includes the application identity, but also proves cryptographically that it is from a valid client.
This payload takes the form of a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519"><strong>signed JSON Web Token
(JWT)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The application identity string will be carried as one of the JWT claim fields. (TODO: which one?)
Since the JWT will be signed, this allows the security service to verify that it is genuine, and
thus permit the call to go ahead with the required level of isolation.</p>
<p>JWT tokens are not directly signed by client applications, since client applications do not
participate in any of the trust relationships that this system architecture has defined. Instead,
they are signed by the identity provider, and passed back to the client application in order to
eventually be forwarded to (and verified by) the security service. The identity provider uses its
private key to sign the JWT. The security service has the public part of this key, and is hence able
to perform the verification. The identity provider and the security service share one of the trust
relationships that were defined above.</p>
<h4 id="unix-peer-credentials"><a class="header" href="#unix-peer-credentials">Unix Peer Credentials</a></h4>
<p>Another solution to the authentication problem is to use Unix peer credentials with the <a href="../parsec_service/authenticators.html">Unix peer
credentials authenticator</a>. Unix peer credentials are
connection metadata which specify the effective Unix user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) of the
connecting process. When using a Unix domain sockets transport, the endpoints can get each other's
UID and GID via the operating system.</p>
<p>In Unix peer credential authentication, the connecting process self-declares its UID inside the
authentication header of the request. The Parsec service validates that the self-declared UID
matches the actual UID from the peer credentials. If they match, authentication was successful, and
the application identity is set to the stringified UID.</p>
<h2 id="block-architecture-summary"><a class="header" href="#block-architecture-summary">Block Architecture Summary</a></h2>
<p>Refer to the figure below for a block representation of the key architectural components.</p>
<p><img src="diagrams/system_architecture.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" /></p>
<h2 id="flows"><a class="header" href="#flows">Flows</a></h2>
<h3 id="system-lifecycle-boot"><a class="header" href="#system-lifecycle-boot">System Lifecycle: Boot</a></h3>
<p>The following bootstrapping actions are needed in order to establish the trust relationships that
exist between the orchestrator and the identity provider, and between the identity provider and the
security service respectively. For more details, see the section above on trust relationships. The
bootstrapping flows require each component to generate a root key pair, to store the private key
part in process-local memory, and to share the public part (as an X509 certificate) with the
trusting component.</p>
<p>Public root certificates are shared using the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> API operation, with a flag to
indicate that this is a root certificate as opposed to an intermediate. Both the security service
and the identity provider support this operation via the respective (separate) wire protocol
endpoints.</p>
<p>Root certificates may be shared only once. The <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> operation is defined to fail if
it is called more than once with the root flag set.</p>
<h3 id="system-lifecycle-refresh"><a class="header" href="#system-lifecycle-refresh">System Lifecycle: Refresh</a></h3>
<p>Background flows occur on a periodic cadence while the system is active, and they are aimed at
maintaining the trust relationships between the orchestrator, identity provider and security
service.</p>
<p>Trust relationships require intermediate key pairs to be generated periodically in order to fulfil
the stated design objective around short-lived cryptography. The root key pairs generated in the
bootstrapping phase do not fulfill this objective by themselves.</p>
<p>Intermediate key pairs are generated by both the orchestrator and identity provider. Each component
stores its private key in local process memory, but needs to share the public key. As with the
bootstrapping flows, the orchestrator shares its public key with the identity provider, and the
identity provider shares its public key with the security service. There is a common API in the wire
protocol to support this operation.</p>
<p>Public intermediate certificates are shared using the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> API operation, with a
flag to indicate that this is an intermediate certificate as opposed to a root. Both the security
service and the identity provider support this operation via the respective (separate) wire protocol
endpoints.</p>
<p>Intermediate public certificates may be shared any number of times. Any previous intermediate
certificate is immediately invalidated upon the event of a new intermediate being shared.</p>
<h3 id="application-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#application-lifecycle">Application Lifecycle</a></h3>
<p>Client application lifecycles are governed by the orchestrator. The orchestrator is responsible for
starting and stopping the client application containers or processes. It is also responsible for
notifying these events to the identity provider, and for sending the client definitions and client
proofs.</p>
<p>To add a new client definition to the identity provider, the orchestrator calls the <strong>AddClient</strong>
operation with a signed data payload containing the client definition properties (typically a JSON
document).</p>
<p>Having informed the identity provider of a new client definition, the next role of the orchestrator
is to run an attestation process to prove its validity. The results of the attestation process are
then sent to the identity provider using the <strong>ProveClient</strong> operation, again with a signed data
payload containing the proofs.</p>
<h3 id="general-usage-flows"><a class="header" href="#general-usage-flows">General Usage Flows</a></h3>
<p>The final flow to consider is the general use case of the client application making a call to the
security service to perform a cryptographic operation with isolation. This is obviously the most
commonly-occurring flow, and everything else in the system is geared towards enabling this
fundamental operation.</p>
<p>This flow begins with the client application, which consumes the security API via the client
library. Recall that client libraries exist for a variety of popular programming languages. Recall
also that each client library offers a highly-designed developer experience, with appropriate levels
of simplification and argument defaulting so that common cryptographic use cases are catered for
with a minimum of effort on the part of the application developer.</p>
<p>The client library is responsible for implementing the language-specific idioms in terms of one or
more wire protocol API calls to the security service. In order to make these calls, it needs a
signed JWT token that embeds the correct application identity for the client. These tokens come from
the identity provider. Hence the client library must first call the identity provider to obtain this
token. It can then call the security service with the signed token.</p>
<p>The security service is responsible for verifying the token and extracting the application identity
from it. This identity can then be used as a namespace for all secure assets that are stored for
that client.</p>
<p>Once the security service has verified and accepted a call to an API operation, it becomes the
responsibility of the back-end cryptographic provider to actually implement the call either in
software or hardware. Once the operation has been executed, the results can be marshalled back to
the client library, which can once again implement whatever simplifications or interpretations are
required to make them suitable for the application developer.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-diagram"><a class="header" href="#sequence-diagram">Sequence Diagram</a></h3>
<p>All flows are summarized and captured in the sequence diagram below. The diagram attempts to collect
together and summarize all of the flows that are needed for bootstrapping, background operations and
also general usage as described above. In order to strike the right balance between completeness and
simplicity, the flow diagram does not include every possible path. In particular, the actions taken
in response to errors or failed verifications are not captured here.</p>

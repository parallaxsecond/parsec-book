<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="welcome-to-parsec"><a class="header" href="#welcome-to-parsec">Welcome to Parsec</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parsec</strong> is the <strong>P</strong>latform <strong>A</strong>bst<strong>R</strong>action for <strong>SEC</strong>urity, a new open-source initiative to
provide a common <a href="parsec_client/api_overview.html">API</a> to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.</p>
<p>Parsec aims to define a universal software standard for interacting with secure object storage and
cryptography services, creating a common way to interface with functions that would traditionally
have been accessed by more specialized APIs. Parsec establishes an ecosystem of developer-friendly
libraries in a variety of popular programming languages. Each library is designed to be highly
ergonomic and simple to consume. This growing ecosystem will put secure facilities at the fingertips
of developers across a broad range of use cases in infrastructure computing, edge computing and the
secure Internet of Things.</p>
<h1 id="why-platform-agnostic-security"><a class="header" href="#why-platform-agnostic-security">Why Platform-Agnostic Security?</a></h1>
<p>Today's computing platforms have evolved to offer a range of facilities for secure storage and
secure operations. There are hardware-backed facilities such as the Hardware Security Module (HSM)
or Trusted Platform Module (TPM). There are firmware services running in Trusted Execution
Environments (TEE). There are also cloud-based security services. At a bare minimum, security
facilities may be provided purely in software, where they are protected by mechanisms provided in
the operating system.</p>
<p>Over the years, software standards have emerged to allow developers to use these facilities from
their applications. But these standards bring with them the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are defined with the expectation that the caller is the &quot;owner&quot; of the platform, meaning that
it has sole access to the underlying hardware. In reality, this is often not the case, because
the caller might reside in a container or virtual machine, where it is sharing the host hardware
with other applications. Existing software standards do not cater well for this situation.</li>
<li>They are defined exhaustively, with lengthy specifications detailing all permissible operations
and parameters. They are written from the perspective of the security device and its
capabilities, rather than from the perspective of the application and its use case. This can
offer a daunting and bewildering experience for developers, who spend a lot of time and effort
figuring out how to map their use case onto the API. There is nothing to tailor the API so that
it can be consumed easily for common, simple cases.</li>
<li>They are specific to a programming language such as C. To consume them in other languages, it is
necessary to use interoperability layers such as Foreign Function Interface (FFI), which can make
the developer experience even more cumbersome and unnatural. Interoperability layers can also be
a source of vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Standards tend to be adopted based on some knowledge of the target platform. So while it might be
possible for code to be portable across multiple HSM vendors, for example, it is much harder to
make code portable between an HSM-based platform and a TPM-based platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parsec inverts this traditional approach to standardizing security interfaces, and it does so by
putting applications front and center. It offers an API that is no less comprehensive, but it does
so in a way that puts the needs of applications and their common use cases first.</p>
<p>Applications simply want the best-available security, and they want to be able to consume it in a
way that is simple, natural, and hard to get wrong.</p>
<p>The following observations can be made about such applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be written in a variety of programming languages.</li>
<li>They may be written with no explicit knowledge of the hardware capabilities of the target
platform, such as whether an HSM or TPM is available.</li>
<li>They are often sharing the target platform hardware with other applications due to the use of
virtualization or containerization technology.</li>
<li>The secure assets owned by one application must be isolated from those owned by another. For
example, private keys provisioned on a hardware device must be isolated such that only the
provisioning application would be able to perform subsequent operations with those keys.</li>
<li>They have differing requirements in terms of permissible cryptographic algorithms and key
strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>These observations motivate the need for a new platform abstraction that offers a common palette of
security primitives via a software interface that is both agnostic with respect to the underlying
hardware capabilities, and also capable of supporting multiple client applications on the same host,
whether those be within containers or within traditional virtual machines.</p>
<p>Parsec is a new software architecture and ecosystem that addresses this need.</p>
<h1 id="basis-in-platform-security-architecture"><a class="header" href="#basis-in-platform-security-architecture">Basis in Platform Security Architecture</a></h1>
<p>Parsec is founded on the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/security-architectures/platform-security-architecture"><strong>Platform Security Architecture
(PSA)</strong></a>.
The PSA is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture
specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. The PSA provides a recipe,
based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a
hardware and firmware level.</p>
<p>One of the provisions of the PSA is the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto
API</strong></a>.
The PSA Crypto API is a comprehensive library of modern security primitives covering the following
functional areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key provisioning and management</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Signing</li>
<li>Message Authentication Codes (MAC)</li>
<li>Asymmetric encryption</li>
<li>Symmetric encryption</li>
<li>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)</li>
<li>Key derivation</li>
<li>Entropy (random number generation)</li>
</ul>
<p>A crucial characteristic of the PSA Crypto API is that applications always reference the keys
opaquely, making it ideally suited to implementations where keys are provisioned within hardware and
are never exposed.</p>
<p>The PSA Crypto API is defined in the C language. Parsec adopts the operations and contracts of the C
API, and uses them as the basis for a language-independent <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a>. Each <a href="parsec_client/operations">operation</a> is defined,
along with all of its inputs and outputs, as a serializable contract, making it suitable to be
invoked over an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) transport. Parsec maintains functional equivalence
with the PSA Crypto API, but allows for out-of-process callers in any programming language.</p>
<h1 id="the-parsec-service"><a class="header" href="#the-parsec-service">The Parsec Service</a></h1>
<p>The core component of Parsec is the <strong>security service</strong> (or <strong>security daemon</strong>). This is a
background process that runs on the host platform and provides connectivity with the secure
facilities of that host and surfaces the wire protocol based on PSA Crypto.</p>
<p>The security service listens on a suitable transport medium. The transport technology is one of
Parsec's many pluggable components, and no single transport is mandated. Choice of transport is
dependent on the operating system and the deployment. On Linux-based systems where the client
applications are running in containers (isolation with a shared kernel), the transport can be based
on Unix sockets.</p>
<p>Client applications make connections with the service by posting API requests to the transport
endpoint. This is usually done via a client library that hides the details of both the wire protocol
and the transport. This is one of the ways in which the client library simplifies the experience of
Parsec for application developers.</p>
<p>A single instance of the Parsec service executes on each physical host. In virtualized environments,
the Parsec service may reside on a specially-assigned guest, or potentially within the hypervisor.</p>
<p>The security service does not support remote client applications. Each physical host or node must
have its own instance of the service. However, it is possible for the service to initiate outbound
remote calls of other services, such as cloud-hosted HSM services.</p>
<h1 id="multitenancy-and-access-control"><a class="header" href="#multitenancy-and-access-control">Multitenancy and Access Control</a></h1>
<p>In addition to surfacing the common API, the Parsec service is also responsible for brokering access
to the underlying security facilities amongst the multiple client applications. The exact way that
this is done will vary from one deployment to another. (See the section below on pluggable back-end
modules). Some of the brokering functionality may already reside in kernel drivers and other parts
of the software stack. The Parsec service is responsible for creating isolated views of key storage
and cryptographic services for each client application. The secure assets of one client must be kept
protected from those of another.</p>
<p>Central to this multi-tenant operation is the notion of <strong>application identity</strong> and the need for a
separate <strong>identity provider</strong> service. A Parsec-enabled host must contain an identity provider
service in addition to the Parsec service itself.</p>
<p>For more information about application identities and the identity provider, please refer to the
<a href="archive/system_architecture.html"><strong>system architecture</strong></a> document.</p>
<h1 id="pluggable-back-end-modules"><a class="header" href="#pluggable-back-end-modules">Pluggable Back-End Modules</a></h1>
<p>The Parsec service employs a layered architecture, structured into a front-end and a back-end.</p>
<p>The front-end module provides the transport endpoint and listens for connections from clients. The
front-end understands the wire protocol and the common API. It is responsible for serialization and
de-serialization of the operation contracts.</p>
<p>The back-end modules are known as <strong>providers</strong>. An instance of the Parsec security service can load
one or more providers. Providers implement the API operations using platform-specific or
vendor-specific code. They provide the &quot;last mile&quot; of connectivity down to the underlying hardware,
software or firmware.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into the modular structure of the Parsec service, please take a look at the
<a href="parsec_service/interfaces_and_dataflow.html"><strong>interfaces and dataflow</strong></a> design document.</p>
<p>Then delve into the <a href="parsec_service/source_code_structure.html"><strong>source code</strong></a> to discover the
back-end provider modules that exist. If you cannot find one that is compatible with the platform
you intend to use, then please consider contributing a new provider.</p>
<h1 id="beautiful-client-libraries"><a class="header" href="#beautiful-client-libraries">Beautiful Client Libraries</a></h1>
<p>A key aim of Parsec is to evolve an ecosystem of developer-friendly client libraries in multiple
programming languages.</p>
<p>Parsec avoids the cumbersome, auto-generated language bindings that are so often a part of
standardized interfaces.</p>
<p>Parsec's client libraries are beautiful.</p>
<p>Each client library is carefully crafted to follow the idioms of the language that it targets.
Consuming a Parsec client library will always feel natural to a developer who works in that
language. Everything from naming conventions to object lifecycle will be blended to create a
highly-idiomatic developer experience.</p>
<p>But Parsec's focus on developer ergonomics goes further than this. Parsec's client interface is
filled with conveniences to eliminate complexity unless complexity is required. The Parsec API is
functionally equivalent with the PSA Crypto API, and none of this functional completeness is lost in
the client layer. All possible variants of key type and algorithm type are exposed in case they are
needed. But the client library offers smart default behaviors so that simple use cases can be
achieved with very little code. Parsec enables client code to be small and elegant. And even if it
needs to be less small, it should still be elegant.</p>

<h2 id="is-parsec-already-running"><a class="header" href="#is-parsec-already-running">Is Parsec Already Running?</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to check whether Parsec is already installed and running on your system is to open a
terminal window and issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool ping
</code></pre>
<p>If the Parsec components are installed and running, this command will produce output similar to the
following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO] Service wire protocol version
1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If this fails, then do not worry. Read on to learn the best way to get Parsec up and running on your
system.</p>
<h2 id="option-1-install-parsec-using-the-package-manager"><a class="header" href="#option-1-install-parsec-using-the-package-manager">Option 1: Install Parsec Using the Package Manager</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install Parsec is by using the package manager on your system. Parsec is
available as a package in Fedora and openSUSE Linux distributions. If you are using one of these
distributions, follow the guide below to get Parsec installed and working.</p>
<h3 id="installing-the-parsec-packages"><a class="header" href="#installing-the-parsec-packages">Installing the Parsec Packages</a></h3>
<p>To install Parsec on <strong>openSUSE Tumbleweed or openSUSE Leap 15.3 (and later)</strong>, just install
<code>parsec</code> and <code>parsec-tool</code> from YaST (graphical UI), or from zypper (command line):</p>
<pre><code>sudo zypper install parsec parsec-tool
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use SUSE SLE15-SP3 (or later), <code>parsec</code> and <code>parsec-tool</code> are available from
Package-Hub repository. So, please enable Package-Hub before trying to install those packages.</p>
<p>To install Parsec on <strong>Fedora 34 (and later)</strong>, you can run the following command from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dnf install parsec parsec-tool
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setting-up-user-permissions"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-user-permissions">Setting Up User Permissions</a></h3>
<p>When you install Parsec with the package manager (on either openSUSE or Fedora), the package
installation scripts will include the creation of a <code>parsec-clients</code> user group. Client applications
that wish to use the Parsec service should first be made members of this group, otherwise they will
be denied permission to access the service endpoint. To make your current user a member of
<code>parsec-clients</code>, issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo usermod -a -G parsec-clients $USER
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that this change will <em>not</em> be applied immediately within your current terminal window.
To ensure that these changes take effect, you can either log out and log back in as the same user,
or you can forcibly apply the changes using this command:</p>
<pre><code>newgrp parsec-clients
</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that the current user is a member of the <code>parsec-clients</code> group, use this command:</p>
<pre><code>groups
</code></pre>
<p>and ensure that <code>parsec-clients</code> is in the list of groups.</p>
<h3 id="starting-the-parsec-service"><a class="header" href="#starting-the-parsec-service">Starting the Parsec Service</a></h3>
<p>When you install Parsec with the package manager, it will be installed as a system service. Use the
following command to start the service immediately, and also ensure that it is enabled for automatic
start on subsequent system boot:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable --now parsec.service
</code></pre>
<h3 id="checking-the-installation"><a class="header" href="#checking-the-installation">Checking the Installation</a></h3>
<p>To check that the installation is functional, issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool ping
</code></pre>
<p>If the Parsec components are correctly installed and running, you should see output similar to the
following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO] Service wire protocol version
1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If instead you see an error message, go back through the above steps and ensure that the service was
started, and that your current user is a member of the <code>parsec-clients</code> group.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-download-a-quick-start-release"><a class="header" href="#option-2-download-a-quick-start-release">Option 2: Download a Quick-Start Release</a></h2>
<p>If you are using a system that does not support installing Parsec through the package manager, you
can get familiar with Parsec by downloading the latest release from GitHub and running it manually
as a quick-start package. This is currently supported for any 64-bit Linux system running on the x86
architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method is suitable for familiarization and experimentation only. <strong>Do not</strong> use this
method in production environments. To securely install Parsec on Linux for production, check <a href="getting_started/../parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html">this
guide instead</a>.</p>
<h3 id="check-that-your-system-is-suitable"><a class="header" href="#check-that-your-system-is-suitable">Check that Your System is Suitable</a></h3>
<p>To download a pre-built release of Parsec, you need to be running a 64-bit Linux system on the x86
architecture, and you need to have at least version 2.27 of the Gnu C Library (<code>GLIBC</code>), which you
can check by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>ldd --version
</code></pre>
<h3 id="download-the-latest-quick-start-release-bundle"><a class="header" href="#download-the-latest-quick-start-release-bundle">Download the Latest Quick-Start Release Bundle</a></h3>
<p>Run the following command to download and unpack the <code>quickstart-1.2.0-linux_x86_64</code> folder.</p>
<pre><code>curl -s -N -L https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/releases/download/1.2.0/quickstart-1.2.0-linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting directory contains the following structure</p>
<pre><code>quickstart-1.2.0-linux_x86_64
├── bin
│   ├── parsec                 # The parsec binary
│   └── parsec-tool            # The parsec client tool
└── quickstart
    ├── README.md              # Quickstart README
    ├── build.txt              # Information about the Parsec build environment
    ├── config.toml            # The config file used by parsec
    └── parsec-cli-tests.sh    # Standard parsec-tool tests
</code></pre>
<p>The following examples assume you've navigated to the <code>quickstart-1.2.0-linux_x86_64/quickstart</code>
directory, so let's do that now.</p>
<pre><code>cd quickstart-1.2.0-linux_x86_64/quickstart
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-your-environment"><a class="header" href="#configure-your-environment">Configure Your Environment</a></h3>
<p>Calls to the <code>parsec-tool</code> assume that the environment variable <code>PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> has been
set to the path for the socket created by the <code>parsec</code> process. By default, that socket is placed in
the directory where you've executed the <code>parsec</code> command, so we can configure that variable as such</p>
<pre><code>export PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=unix:$(pwd)/parsec.sock
</code></pre>
<p>It may also be helpful to add the <code>bin</code> directory to your path. The examples below assume that this
has been done.</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/../bin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="start-the-parsec-service"><a class="header" href="#start-the-parsec-service">Start the Parsec Service</a></h3>
<p>Start the Parsec service with this command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>You should see some lines of console output as the service starts, ending with the following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO  parsec] Parsec is ready.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-the-parsec-tool"><a class="header" href="#using-the-parsec-tool">Using the Parsec Tool</a></h3>
<p>You can now use the <code>parsec-tool</code> to check that the service is running:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool ping
</code></pre>
<p>If the Parsec components are correctly downloaded and running, you should see output similar to the
following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO] Service wire protocol version
1.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="controlling-the-service-manually"><a class="header" href="#controlling-the-service-manually">Controlling the Service Manually</a></h3>
<p>When using the Parsec service as a pre-built download, it will not be installed as a system service.
Therefore, to stop the service, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pkill parsec
</code></pre>
<p>You should see some lines of output ending with:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO parsec] Parsec is now terminated.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also cause the service to restart, which can be useful if you have made some configuration
changes for example. This command will cause the service to reload its configuration and restart:</p>
<pre><code>pkill -SIGHUP parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this will produce some lines of output, and the final line will be:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO parsec] Parsec configuration reloaded.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-the-test-script"><a class="header" href="#running-the-test-script">Running the Test Script</a></h3>
<p>The quick-start bundle also contains the <code>parsec-cli-tests.sh</code> testing script, which executes a
simple set of tests to ensure that the Parsec service is operating correctly. Some of these tests
use the local <code>openssl</code> installation as a point of comparison, ensuring that Parsec's results are
equivalent to those expected by <code>openssl</code>.</p>
<p>As this script uses the <code>parsec-tool</code>, the <code>PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> environment variable needs to
be set as follows:</p>

<h2 id="option-3-use-a-quickstart-docker-image"><a class="header" href="#option-3-use-a-quickstart-docker-image">Option 3: Use a Quickstart Docker Image</a></h2>
<p>If you'd like to isolate your quickstart experience to a temporary Docker container, you can get
familiar with Parsec by utilizing a pre-built image available on ghcr.io. This is currently
supported for any system able to run 64-bit Linux x86 Docker images.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method is suitable for familiarization and experimentation only. <strong>Do not</strong> use this
method in production environments. To securely install Parsec on Linux for production, check <a href="getting_started/../parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html">this
guide instead</a>.</p>
<h3 id="check-that-your-system-is-suitable-1"><a class="header" href="#check-that-your-system-is-suitable-1">Check that Your System is Suitable</a></h3>
<p>To run a Docker container, you need to have Docker installed on your system. If you do not, you
follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker to install Docker.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-latest-quick-start-release-image"><a class="header" href="#run-the-latest-quick-start-release-image">Run the Latest Quick-Start Release Image</a></h3>
<p>Run the following command to pull and run the Parsec quickstart image.</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm --name parsec -it ghcr.io/parallaxsecond/parsec-quickstart bash
</code></pre>
<p>This will start the <code>parsec-quickstart</code> image and place you into the <code>/parsec/quickstart</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>/parsec</code> directory has the following structure</p>
<pre><code>/parsec

<p>When using the Parsec service as a pre-built download, it will not be installed as a system service.
Therefore, to stop the service, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pkill parsec
</code></pre>
<p>You should see some lines of output ending with:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO parsec] Parsec is now terminated.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also cause the service to restart, which can be useful if you have made some configuration
changes for example. This command will cause the service to reload its configuration and restart:</p>
<pre><code>pkill -SIGHUP parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this will produce some lines of output, and the final line will be:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO parsec] Parsec configuration reloaded.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-the-test-script-1"><a class="header" href="#running-the-test-script-1">Running the Test Script</a></h3>
<p>The quick-start image also contains the <code>parsec-cli-tests.sh</code> testing script, which executes a

use the local <code>openssl</code> installation as a point of comparison, ensuring that Parsec's results are
equivalent to those expected by <code>openssl</code>. The image has a valid version of <code>openssl</code> installed.</p>
<p>To run the script, simply execute it from the <code>/parsec/quickstart</code> directory without any arguments

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Many useful Parsec operations can be performed using Parsec's command-line tool, known as
<code>parsec-tool</code>. The tool can be useful when you need to perform administrative steps in order to
integrate Parsec with another component in your system. Such integrations might require the creation
of a key pair or a certificate request, for example. You can also use the <code>parsec-tool</code> in your
shell scripts when you need to automate seqeuences of operations for key management and
cryptogpraohy. Use this short guide to get familiar with basic use of the most common operations.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-parsec-command-line-tool"><a class="header" href="#installing-the-parsec-command-line-tool">Installing the Parsec Command-Line Tool</a></h2>
<p>To use this guide, you need to have <code>parsec-tool</code> installed or built.</p>
<p>For installing, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install parsec-tool
</code></pre>
<p>For building it, use the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:parallaxsecond/parsec-tool.git
cd parsec-tool
cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>To run the example commands in this guide, you will also need to ensure that the <code>parsec-tool</code>
application is available on your <code>$PATH</code>. If you installed the tool using a package manager, then
this will happen automatically. If you downloaded a binary or built the tool yourself from source
code, you may need to modify your <code>$PATH</code>, or copy the <code>parsec-tool</code> application into a folder that
is already searched.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, ensure that you can run <code>parsec-tool</code> from your shell or terminal window as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool
</code></pre>
<p>This should display a help summary.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-version"><a class="header" href="#checking-the-version">Checking the Version</a></h2>
<p>The following command will display the version number for the <code>parsec-tool</code> installation that you
are using:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool --version
</code></pre>
<p>You normally don't need to worry about the version. Parsec is designed with a robust protocol
between client applications and the service. It should be possible for any version of the
<code>parsec-tool</code> to work with any other version of the Parsec service. However, running an older
version of the <code>parsec-tool</code> might mean that some commands are unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="getting-help-with-commands"><a class="header" href="#getting-help-with-commands">Getting Help With Commands</a></h2>
<p>This document does not contain detailed man pages for all of the commands. We hope to be able to
make man pages for <code>parsec-tool</code> available online in the future. For the time being, you can use the
tool itself to generate help text for the available operations.</p>
<p>To generate a help summary for the tool as a whole, simply invoke <code>parsec-tool</code> without any
arguments, or with the <code>--help</code> argument. This will display the summary help text, which includes a
list of all available commands.</p>
<p>To get more detailed help text for a specific command, use the <code>--help</code> option for that command. For
example, to get help text for the <code>create-rsa-key</code> command, you would type:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool create-rsa-key --help
</code></pre>
<p>This will provide a full help text for the command, including documentation for all of the
command-line parameters that this command accepts.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-service-api-endpoint"><a class="header" href="#setting-the-service-api-endpoint">Setting the Service API Endpoint</a></h2>
<p>Parsec uses a Unix domain socket to carry commands and responses between client applications and the
service. Since <code>parsec-tool</code> is a Parsec client application, it also uses this domain socket to send
commands to the service. By default, the Parsec domain socket has a full path of
<code>/run/parsec/parsec.sock</code>. The <code>parsec-tool</code> will expect to find the socket endpoint at this
location.</p>
<p>If your service configuration has been modified to use a non-default socket path, then you will need
to tell the <code>parsec-tool</code> to find the socket at its correct place. Set the environment variable
<code>PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> in your shell before using the <code>parsec-tool</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>export PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=unix:/correct/path/to/parsec/endpoint/parsec.sock
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pinging-the-service"><a class="header" href="#pinging-the-service">Pinging the Service</a></h2>
<p>Before running any other operations, it is useful first to check that the Parsec service is running
and healthy. To use the <code>parsec-tool</code>, you type <code>parsec-tool</code>, followed by the name of the command
that you want to run, followed by any additional arguments that are needed by that specific command.
The <code>ping</code> command is the simplest command, and it doesn't require any additional arguments:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool ping
</code></pre>
<p>If the service is running and healthy, you will see output as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO] Service wire protocol version
1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If you see this message, your Parsec service is running and responding normally, and you can proceed
with the other examples in this guide.</p>
<p>If you don't see this message, check the troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see the error <code>parsec-tool: command not found</code> it means that <code>parsec-tool</code> is either not
installed or cannot be found in any of the directories on your <code>$PATH</code>. Check the <a href="getting_started/installation_options.html">installation
guide</a> to learn how to obtain the <code>parsec-tool</code> and to ensure that it
can be found.</li>
<li>The fault message <code>[ERROR] Error spinning up the BasicClient: the socket address provided in the URL is not valid</code> might be seen. This might mean that <code>parsec-tool</code> is trying to locate the
service API endpoint at the wrong location. By default, <code>parsec-tool</code> expects the Parsec service
endpoint to be <code>/run/parsec/parsec.sock</code>. If your Parsec service is using a different endpoint,
then you need to set the <code>PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> environment variable to the correct path. See
the section above on <a href="getting_started/parsec_tool_use.html#setting-the-service-api-endpoint">setting the endpoint</a>. Another cause of
this error might be that your current user is not a member of the <code>parsec-clients</code> group. When
you install Parsec using a package manager, the package scripts normally create <code>parsec-clients</code>
group, and only users who are members of this group are allowed to contact the service endpoint.
Use the <code>groups</code> command to list the groups that your current user is a member of, and refer to
the <a href="getting_started/installation_options.html#setting-up-user-permissions">installation guide</a> for help on setting
the correct permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these steps do not help, the Parsec community may be able to assist you. We are always very happy
to hear from users with your questions and queries. Head over to the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/community">community</a> repo to learn how to get in touch via Slack

<h2 id="checking-the-service-back-end-configuration"><a class="header" href="#checking-the-service-back-end-configuration">Checking the Service Back-End Configuration</a></h2>
<p>The <code>parsec-tool</code> includes commands that can help you check on how the service has been set up.
These checks can be useful, for example, if you wish to make sure that the Parsec service is using
the correct secure hardware on your device, such as your Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or Hardware
Security Module (HSM).</p>
<p>To check the hardware back-end configuration of Parsec on your device, run this command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool list-providers
</code></pre>
<p>This command displays a list of the back-end provider modules that have been activated in the Parsec
service. The entry at the <strong>top</strong> of this list is the most important one, because this entry tells
you which back-end provider will be used by default. You should pay particular attention to this
entry, and ensure that it matches your expectations for how Parsec has been integrated with your
device hardware.</p>
<p>If you are experimenting or prototyping with Parsec in a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) or non-production
environment, you will probably be using the software back-end (also known as the <em>Mbed Crypto</em> or
<em>Mbed TLS</em> back-end). This is the back-end provider that is configured out of the box in new Parsec
installations. It will appear in the list as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x01 (Mbed Crypto provider)
Description: User space software provider, based on Mbed Crypto - the reference implementation of the PSA crypto API
Version: 0.1.0
Vendor: Arm
UUID: 1c1139dc-ad7c-47dc-ad6b-db6fdb466552
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using this back-end, then you should be aware that it does not offer any specific
security features. This back-end provider is suitable for evaluation and experimentation only.</p>
<p>For Parsec to be integrated with a hardware or firmware TPM on your device, the topmost back-end
provider should be the TPM provider, which will appear as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x03 (TPM provider)
Description: TPM provider, interfacing with a library implementing the TCG TSS 2.0 Enhanced System API specification.
Version: 0.1.0
Vendor: Trusted Computing Group (TCG)
UUID: 1e4954a4-ff21-46d3-ab0c-661eeb667e1d
</code></pre>
<p>For Parsec to be integrated with a hardware module using the PKCS#11 interface, the topmost entry
should be:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x02 (PKCS #11 provider)
Description: PKCS #11 provider, interfacing with a PKCS #11 library.
Version: 0.1.0
Vendor: OASIS Standard.
UUID: 30e39502-eba6-4d60-a4af-c518b7f5e38f
</code></pre>
<p>For hardware accessed through a <code>CryptoAuthLib</code> interface, the entry should be:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x05 (CryptoAuthentication Library provider)
Description: User space hardware provider, utilizing MicrochipTech CryptoAuthentication Library for ATECCx08 chips
Version: 0.1.0
Vendor: Arm
UUID: b8ba81e2-e9f7-4bdd-b096-a29d0019960c
</code></pre>
<p>For Parsec to integrate with a <a href="https://www.psacertified.org/blog/what-is-a-root-of-trust/">PSA
root-of-trust</a> implementation via the
<a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/trusted-services/">Trusted Services</a> project, the entry
should be:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x04 (Trusted Service provider)
Description: Software exposing functionality provided by the Crypto Trusted Service running in a Trusted Execution Environment
Version: 0.1.0
Vendor: Arm
UUID: 71129441-508a-4da6-b6e8-7b98a777e4c0
</code></pre>
<p>In all configurations, there will be a final entry in the list that reads as follows, indicating the
core back-end that is always enabled for administrative operations:</p>
<pre><code>ID: 0x00 (Core Provider)
Description: Software provider that implements only administrative (i.e. no cryptographic) operations
Version: 0.8.0
Vendor: Unspecified
UUID: 47049873-2a43-4845-9d72-831eab668784
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn more details about the different Parsec back-end providers
<a href="getting_started/../parsec_service/providers.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-service-front-end-configuration"><a class="header" href="#checking-the-service-front-end-configuration">Checking the Service Front-End Configuration</a></h2>
<p>The Parsec service includes front-end configuration modules known as <em>authenticators</em>. These are
used to ensure that the operations of multiple client applications are kept separate from one
another. Parsec authenticator modules contain logic to decide on the identity of any client
application that is using the service. Client applications of any given identity will each have
their own namespace, which means that any named keys that they create will be visible only to them,
and never to other client applications.</p>
<p>The following command can be used to display the authenticator mechanism that is in use:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool list-authenticators
</code></pre>
<p>By default, this command will output the following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO ] Available authenticators:
ID: 0x03 (Unix Peer Credentials authentication)
Description: Uses Unix peer credentials to authenticate the client. Verifies that the self-declared Unix user identifier (UID) in the request's authentication header matches that which is found from the peer credentials.
Version: 0.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>This message means that Parsec will use the Unix user identifier of each client process as the scope
of the namespace. Any client applications that run as the same Unix user will be considered the same
client, and will see the same set of created keys. Client applications running as different Unix
users will likewise see different sets of keys.</p>
<p>It is also possible for client applications to be differentiated based on a
<a href="https://spiffe.io">SPIFFE</a> identity. If authentication has been configured in this way, then the
command output will look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO ] Available authenticators:
ID: 0x04 (JWT SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document authentication)
Description: Authenticator validating a JWT SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document
Version: 0.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>The final supported method is known as <em>Direct Authentication</em>. This method is not recommended for
production environments, but it can be used for evaluation. In this mode, the Parsec service will
allow each client application to declare its own identity as a simple string, which will not be
validated in any way. Client applications need to trust each other to use distinct strings in a
sensible way. When this method is configured, the command output will read as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO ] Available authenticators:
ID: 0x01 (Direct authentication)
Description: Directly parses the authentication field as a UTF-8 string and uses that as the application identity. Should be used for testing only.
Version: 0.1.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="signing-with-an-elliptic-curve-key"><a class="header" href="#signing-with-an-elliptic-curve-key">Signing with an Elliptic Curve Key</a></h2>
<p>Let's learn how to create an Elliptic Curve (EC) key pair in Parsec, and use it to sign a message.
Create an EC key pair with the default curve and settings as follows:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool create-ecc-key --key-name my-ecc-key
</code></pre>
<p>This command will produce the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO ] Creating ECC signing key...
[INFO ] Key &quot;my-ecc-key&quot; created.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>list-keys</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool list-keys
</code></pre>
<p>This will list the key that you just created, in addition to any others that have been created by
the same client:</p>
<pre><code>* my-ecc-key (Mbed Crypto provider, EccKeyPair { curve_family: SecpR1 }, 256 bits, permitted algorithm: AsymmetricSignature(Ecdsa { hash_alg: Specific(Sha256) }))
</code></pre>
<p>You can export the public part of the key using the <code>export-public-key</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool export-public-key --key-name my-ecc-key
</code></pre>
<p>This will output the public part of the key in PEM format, similar to the output shown below:</p>

set its purpose as a signing key:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool create-rsa-key --key-name my-rsa-signing-key --for-signing
</code></pre>
<p>This will create an RSA signing key of the default key strength, which is 2048 bits. You can use the
<code>list-keys</code> command to check that this key was created:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool list-keys
</code></pre>
<p>This will list the key that you just created, in addition to any others that have been created by

<p>You wouldn't normally perform both the encryption and decryption using <code>parsec-tool</code> in this way.
More commonly, the encryption part would be done by an external component using the exported public
key, and only the decryption part would be performed inside Parsec (which has exclusive access to
the private key). This <a href="https://youtu.be/ows1-_dxZfw?t=47">tutorial video</a> shows a similar
demonstration of an RSA encryption workflow using <code>parsec-tool</code>, where the encryption is performed
externally using an online encryption tool.</p>

<p>The Parsec command-line tool can be used to generate random numbers using the entropy facilities
provided by the configured back-end provider. Use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>parsec-tool generate-random --nbytes 8

<p>The output will be similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO ] Generating 8 random bytes...

<p>We can create CSRs using the <code>parsec-tool</code>. Before a CSR can be created, an asymmetric key pair must

<pre><code>parsec-tool create-rsa-key --key-name my-rsa-csr-key --for-signing

<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document introduces the API contract that exists between the client and the service, covering
its general principles and organization. Use this document in combination with the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol
specification</strong></a> and the <a href="parsec_client/operations"><strong>operation directory</strong></a> as a reference
guide for the development of client libraries.</p>
<h2 id="audience"><a class="header" href="#audience">Audience</a></h2>
<p>This document details the API that is exposed directly by the service to its clients. This is the
API that is invoked over the IPC transport between the client process and the service. Client
applications do not consume this API directly. Instead, they consume a client library in their
chosen programming language. The client library will present an idiomatic and simplified view of the
API, making heavy use of argument defaulting to shield application developers from much of the
complexity of invoking cryptographic operations. Client libraries should present the API in a form
that is &quot;easy to use and hard to get wrong&quot;. The audience for this document is the client library
developer, <em>not</em> the application developer. Application developers should consult the client library
documentation package instead.</p>
<h2 id="opcodes-and-contracts"><a class="header" href="#opcodes-and-contracts">Opcodes and Contracts</a></h2>
<p>The API is expressed as a set of individual and distinct <strong>operations</strong>. Each operation has a unique
numerical <strong>opcode</strong> to set it apart from other operations, and to allow for it to be unambiguously
selected for in a client request. (See the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> for
information about how the client must structure such requests). Each operation also has an <strong>input
contract</strong>, which defines the arguments that the client must supply when invoking it. It also has an
<strong>output contract</strong>, which defines the operation results that the client can expect to receive from
the service upon completion. In current manifestations of the API, all input and output contracts
are defined as protobuf messages, which provides a strong contractual definition and good
interoperability with multiple programming languages.</p>
<p>All operations are catalogued in the <a href="parsec_client/operations"><strong>operation directory</strong></a>. There is a separate
documentation page for each operation, which will specify the correct opcode to use, and will
provide links to the input and output contracts.</p>
<p>In order to make an API call, the client must use the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol
specification</strong></a> to form a valid request to the service. The request header must
contain the opcode of the operation being performed, and the request body must contain serialized
data bytes conforming to that operation's input contract. The service will execute the operation,
and form a response according to the wire protocol. The response will contain serialized data bytes
conforming to the operation's output contract.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-providers"><a class="header" href="#selecting-providers">Selecting Providers</a></h2>
<p>All of the operations in the API are implemented by back-end modules known as <strong>providers</strong>. A
provider is a module that is capable of implementing operations by making use of available platform
hardware or services. For example, if cryptographic services are supplied by a hardware secure
element of some kind, then there would be a provider for that secure element. There may be a
different provider for a software-only solution. And so forth. It is valid for these different
providers to co-reside within the service. The availability of providers is governed by
configuration that is applied at service-deployment time.</p>
<p>While the service can be composed from multiple providers, any given API operation needs to be
implemented by a single provider. This means that client code needs to specify the target provider
when it makes an operation request. To achieve this, the service assigns an 8-bit integer value
(from 0 to 255) to each available provider. In practice, the number of providers would be very
small: probably just two or three. This integer value is the <strong>provider identifier</strong>. Client code
must set a single provider identifier in each API request. The <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol
specification</strong></a> explains how a request header field is used to route the request
to the correct provider.</p>
<p>In order to set a provider identifier in an API request, the client must first be able to determine
what providers are available, what their identifiers are, and what their characteristics are (such
as whether they are hardware-backed or software-backed). This is done by first referencing the
<strong>core provider</strong>. The core provider is the only provider that is guaranteed to be available in any
deployment of the service. It has a provider identifier of zero (<code>0x00</code>, the only reserved value for
provider identifiers). The core provider is special in that it doesn't implement any security or
cryptographic operations. The core provider is used to represent the service as a whole. The
operations of the core provider can be used to gather information about the health and configuration
of the service. It can be used to ping the service to check whether it is responsive, and to check
the highest version of the wire protocol that it supports. The core provider can also be used to get
information about the cryptographic providers, their characteristics and their 8-bit identifier
values. Based on this information, the client can determine which provider is best suited to its
requirements. It can then use the integer identifier of that provider to make API requests.</p>
<p>The expected pattern is that a client would determine a single provider that best suits its needs,
and then use that provider exclusively for all cryptographic operations. While this usage would be
considered typical, it is certainly not enforced. There is nothing to prevent a client from using
different providers for different operations if it so desires. In many deployments, it is possible
that only a single cryptographic provider would be available anyway. To determine the best available
or most suitable provider, a client application can use the capability check mechanism, described
below.</p>
<h2 id="open-closed-principle"><a class="header" href="#open-closed-principle">Open-Closed Principle</a></h2>
<p>The API is designed to evolve over time. This evolution will be governed by the <em>open-closed
principle</em>. In practice, this means that each operation in the API, once introduced, will not be
contractually modified. The API can only change by introducing new operations. This preserves
backwards compatibility with client code. Any client code that makes use of any given operation will
continue to work, even if new operations are introduced.</p>
<h3 id="non-breaking-changes"><a class="header" href="#non-breaking-changes">Non-breaking changes</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, it might be helpful to update contracts in a <em>non-breaking way</em>. If multiple
operations share the same parameters (such as the PSA algorithm or key attributes), this avoids
having to duplicate all of them if an update is done to those parameters. To make sure that backward
compatibility with client code is always preserved and that the Parsec service remains stable
through updates, the allowed changes are restricted to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a new <em>optional</em> field to an existing type. If not set, the contract containing the new
field should behave exactly the same as the version without it. The new field should be ignored
if not recognized by an old version. That means that the functionality brought by a new optional
field might not be exercised if the service is older than the client, without an error returned.</li>
<li>Adding a new variant to an existing enumerated type. If not recognized during deserialization, the
<code>InvalidEncoding</code> error should be returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/426">capabilities discovery</a>
operations might be added to give a way for clients to check what parameters are supported. See the
history of this feature <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/388">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deprecation"><a class="header" href="#deprecation">Deprecation</a></h2>
<p>While the open-closed principle dictates that operations will not be contractually changed once they
have been introduced, it may sometimes be necessary to deprecate specific operations. This will
often be to encourage the use of a new operation with an improved feature set and a different
contract. Deprecation is largely a documentation exercise: the <a href="parsec_client/operations"><strong>operation directory</strong></a>
will indicate when an operation has been deprecated. This does not mean that the operation will no
longer work. It simply means that any new use of the operation is strongly discouraged in favor of a
better alternative.</p>
<h2 id="capability-checks"><a class="header" href="#capability-checks">Capability Checks</a></h2>
<p>The API includes a capability check operation, which allows the client to determine the set of
operations that are available. There are two reasons why the client needs this capability check:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API can evolve over time, introducing new operations with new opcodes. In general, a client
cannot know whether it is talking to a service that supports these newer operations, so it needs
to check the level of support in advance.</li>
<li>Different cryptographic providers have different capabilities. An operation that is supported in
one provider might not be supported in another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the <a href="parsec_client/operations"><strong>operation directory</strong></a> for information on how to perform a capability
check.</p>
<h2 id="application-identity"><a class="header" href="#application-identity">Application Identity</a></h2>
<p>Every client application that uses the API must present an <strong>application identity</strong>. Application
identities are arbitrary byte strings, which are used by the service to isolate the activities of
one client from those of another. The storage of secure assets such as keys is segregated on a
per-client basis: assets created by one client cannot be accessed by another. The service always
uses the client's application identity string to maintain this separation.</p>
<p>The means by which application identities are generated or assigned is outside of the scope of this
specification. The only requirements for application identities is that they must be <strong>unique</strong> and
<strong>stable</strong>. This means that any given application identity string can be used to identify one and
only one client application. It also means that the application identity string for any given client
should remain the same over time, even across system resets.</p>
<p>The granularity of application identities is not defined. In particular, there is no assumption that
a client <em>application</em> corresponds precisely with a single client <em>process</em>. A client application
might be composed of multiple processes. Conversely, a single process might contain multiple
distinct client applications. Client applications might also be organized into isolated environments
such as containers. Provided that client application is able to present a unique and stable identity
string for each API call, it does not matter how they are structured and deployed.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-and-sessions"><a class="header" href="#authentication-and-sessions">Authentication and Sessions</a></h2>
<p>Clients present their identity strings to the service on each API call. As set out in the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol specification</strong></a>, they do this using the <strong>authentication</strong> field of the
API request.</p>
<p>There are currently three ways in which the client can use the authentication field to share its
identity with the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>direct authentication</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>authentication tokens</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Unix peer credentials</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <strong>direct authentication</strong>, the client authenticates the request by directly copying the
application identity string into the <strong>authentication</strong> field of the request.</p>
<p>With <strong>authentication tokens</strong>, the client obtains a token from an identity provider and sends it as
the <strong>authentication</strong> field of the request. The token is reusable for a specified duration of time,
after which a new one must be issued. The application identity is contained in the token and can be
extracted by the service after verifying the authenticity of the token. A more detailed description
of authentication tokens and their lifecycle is present in the <a href="parsec_client/../archive/system_architecture.html"><strong>sytem architecture
specification</strong></a>.</p>
<p>With <strong>Unix peer credentials</strong>, the client authenticates by self-declaring its Unix user identifier
(UID) inside the <strong>authentication</strong> field of the request. The Parsec service verifies that this
self-declared UID matches the actual UID of the connecting process via the Unix peer credentials
mechanism.</p>
<p>When it makes an API request, the client needs to tell the server which kind of authentication is
being used. This is so that the server knows how to interpret the bytes in the <strong>authentication</strong>
field of the request. As described in the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a>, the
client does this by setting an integer value in the <strong>auth type</strong> field of the request header. The
permitted numerical values for this field are given as follows:-</p>
<ul>
<li>A value of 0 (<code>0x00</code>) indicates that there is no authentication. The service will not expect any
content in the <strong>authentication</strong> field of the request. If any authentication bytes are present,
they will be ignored, but the request will still be considered valid. (For clients, it is
considered bad practice to supply a non-empty <strong>authentication</strong> field in this case, because it
is contradictory to supply authentication material while indicating an unauthenticated call, and
it indicates improper coding or a possible defect on the client side). See the section below on
unauthenticated operations.</li>
<li>A value of 1 (<code>0x01</code>) indicates direct authentication. The service will expect the
<strong>authentication</strong> field to contain a cleartext copy of the application identity, encoded as a
UTF-8 string.</li>
<li>A value of 2 (<code>0x02</code>) indicates authentication tokens. This authentication type is not currently
supported. The service will expect the <strong>authentication</strong> field to contain a JWT token. Tokens
must be signed with the private key of the identity provider and their validity period must cover
the moment when the check is done.</li>
<li>A value of 3 (<code>0x03</code>) indicates Unix peer credentials authentication. The service expects the
<strong>authentication</strong> field to contain the Unix user identifier (UID, <strong>not</strong> username) of the
connecting process as a zero-padded little-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. The Parsec service
will verify that this self-declared UID is consistent with the UID from the Unix peer
credentials.</li>
<li>A value of 4 (<code>0x04</code>) indicates authentication through JWT SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document.
The service expects the <strong>authentication</strong> field to contain a JWT-SVID token as described in the
<a href="https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/standards/JWT-SVID.md">SPIFFE standard</a>. The token
must be encoded using the JWS Compact Serialization. The service will use the SPIFFE ID validated
from the SVID as application identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other values are unsupported and will be rejected by the service. See the
<a href="parsec_client/../parsec_service/authenticators.html">authenticators</a> page for more details.</p>
<h2 id="unauthenticated-operations"><a class="header" href="#unauthenticated-operations">Unauthenticated Operations</a></h2>
<p>Authentication via the application identity is only needed for cryptographic operations. Core
provider operations do not require authentication. Core provider operations include those that are
used to ping the service and gather information about its capabilities. These operations neither
require nor support any notion of per-client isolation. Consequently, they can be called without any
authentication. For requests to the core provider, the <strong>auth type</strong> header field should always be
set to 0 (<code>0x00</code>).</p>
<h2 id="content-type-and-accept-type"><a class="header" href="#content-type-and-accept-type">Content Type and Accept Type</a></h2>
<p>As per the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a>, API request headers contain fields
for <strong>content type</strong> and <strong>accept type</strong>, which respectively indicate how the request body and
response body are encoded. Currently, the only supported value for these fields is one (<code>0x01</code>),
meaning that all request and response bodies contain serialized protobuf messages. All other values
are unsupported and will be rejected by the service.</p>
<h2 id="psa-crypto-operations"><a class="header" href="#psa-crypto-operations">PSA Crypto Operations</a></h2>
<p>The majority of the operations in this API are derived from the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto API
Specification</strong></a>.
There is a near one-to-one correspondence of functional operations between the two APIs. The main
difference is that the PSA Crypto API is defined in the C programming language, whereas the API
described here is language-agnostic. There is otherwise a close contractual equivalence between the
two, and this is intentional.</p>
<p>In the <a href="parsec_client/operations"><strong>operation directory</strong></a>, operations derived from the PSA Crypto API have
symbolic names that start with the <strong>Psa</strong> prefix, and their numerical opcodes are all in the
1,000-1,999 (decimal) range. Opcode ranges are an important aspect of the API design because they
form the basis of an extensibility mechanism. In the future, it will be possible for contributors to
partition the numerical opcode space with ranges for custom operations.</p>
<h2 id="key-names-enumerating-and-referencing"><a class="header" href="#key-names-enumerating-and-referencing">Key Names, Enumerating and Referencing</a></h2>
<p>While this API is closely aligned with the PSA Crypto API, there are some differences. One important
difference is in the conventions used to name and reference cryptographic keys.</p>
<p>In the PSA Crypto API, every key has a 32-bit numerical identifier. This identifier is set by the
caller when the persistent key is created. Client code then uses this 32-bit identifier to refer to
the key for use in any cryptographic operation.</p>
<p>This API is different: the key names are not 32-bit numerical values, they are <strong>UTF-8 strings</strong>.
Cryptographic operations are all specified in terms of the key name string. It is important to
understand that the opacity of keys - one of the critical design characteristics of the PSA Crypto
API - is preserved here. Key names are used to reference keys for cryptographic operations, but the
actual key material is <em>never</em> exposed to the caller of the API unless an explicit operation is
invoked to export the key (and the key's usage policy permits for such an export to occur).</p>
<p>The use of string names offers greater flexibility in how names can be chosen and structured. It
allows for names to be readable and meaningful. It also allows for names to follow a structured
pattern with separators, similar to a file path. This allows keys to not only be named in meaningful
ways, but also for them to be organized according to a meaningful structure, just like files on a
file system. Keys with a similar purpose, for example, can be stored in the same part of the
notional &quot;tree&quot;.</p>
<p>Key names adopt a path structure similar to Unix file paths, such as <code>/keys/rsa/my_key_1</code>.</p>
<p>This key naming convention permits for the API to support key <strong>enumeration</strong>, where the client is
able to determine the set of known keys according to some wildcard pattern such as <code>/keys/rsa/*</code>.</p>
<p>All key names are implicitly in a per-client namespace, so it is impossible for one client
application to enumerate or otherwise discover the keys that are owned by another client
application.</p>
<p>Providers can impose length restrictions on key names to help with internal storage and argument
validation. This API reference does not define any single fixed maximum length. Clients must
determine the maximum length at runtime using the capability checking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="service-discovery"><a class="header" href="#service-discovery">Service discovery</a></h2>
<p>Establishing a connection between the client and the service requires common understanding of the
communication mechanism and the address at which the service can be found. While the default
mechanism is through a Unix domain socket found at <code>/run/parsec/parsec.sock</code>, that can be easily
changed by an admin for various reasons. Clients must therefore be made aware of such changes and
the defined mechanism for this uses environment variables.</p>
<p>The <code>PARSEC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> environment variable is the preferred method of indicating to a
process where to find the communication channel for the Parsec service. The variable should contain
a URI as defined in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a> - for example, for the default
domain socket location, the URI would be <code>unix:/run/parsec/parsec.sock</code>. Client libraries must be
capable of scanning for the environment variable, parsing it, and bootstrapping communication using
the URI, with no input from the client application. The libraries must also allow the application to
override these settings.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document describes and specifies the wire protocol that exists between the service and its
clients. It explains the general principles of how the protocol is structured, and goes on to
provide a full specification that can be used as the basis of both client-side and service-side
code.</p>
<h2 id="scope"><a class="header" href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the principles, patterns and low-level details of the wire protocol. This
covers the details that are common to all messages that pass between the service and its clients.
This document is <em>not</em> an API specification for the service. Individual API operations, along with
their behaviors, inputs and outputs are described separately in the API specification. The wire
protocol is the underlying message-passing mechanism that enables the API.</p>
<h2 id="audience-1"><a class="header" href="#audience-1">Audience</a></h2>
<p>A thorough understanding of the wire protocol is necessary if you are developing new capabilities
within certain parts of the service, or if you are developing or extending one of its client
libraries. However, it is not necessary to understand the wire protocol in order to consume the
client API into an application.</p>
<h2 id="general-principles"><a class="header" href="#general-principles">General Principles</a></h2>
<h3 id="binary-protocol"><a class="header" href="#binary-protocol">Binary Protocol</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_protocol"><strong>binary</strong></a> and
<strong>stream-oriented</strong> protocol. It is designed for speed and compactness of transmission.</p>
<h3 id="requests-and-responses"><a class="header" href="#requests-and-responses">Requests and Responses</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol is principally structured around the notion of a <strong>request</strong> and a <strong>response</strong>.
Requests and responses are self-contained pairs of entities, where each request is answered by
exactly one response. Requests always travel from the client to the service, and responses always
travel back from the service to the client. Each pair of request and response encapsulates a single
call to a single operation provided by the service. Client library code is concerned with forming
requests and transmitting them to the service. Service code is concerned with processing requests,
forming responses, and transmitting those responses back to the client. The term <strong>message</strong> is used
to refer generically to requests and responses in contexts where there is no need to draw a
distinction between them.</p>
<h3 id="analogy-with-http-and-rest"><a class="header" href="#analogy-with-http-and-rest">Analogy With HTTP and REST</a></h3>
<p>The request-response pattern of the wire protocol is intentionally modeled on the familiar notion of
calling a REST API over HTTP. In fact, one of the guiding principles of the wire protocol design has
been to create something that might loosely be called a &quot;lightweight REST&quot;. This term must be
applied with caution, however. REST is a collection of architectural principles, not a protocol. It
does not follow that all of the RESTful principles are adopted here. However, thinking of the wire
protocol as being like a web service protocol, only without any dependency on HTTP or similar
stacks, can be a good way to gain an initial understanding. Some patterns of the wire protocol
design have their foundation in a mixture of concepts taken from HTTP and REST, but the wire
protocol itself is neither of these things: it is an entirely bespoke protocol.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-operation"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-operation">Synchronous Operation</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol is based on requests and responses, and therefore models synchronous patterns of
interaction. There is nothing in current versions of the protocol to assist with asynchronous
patterns of interaction between the client and the service. Future versions of the protocol may
introduce such concepts. In the meantime, depending on the type of transport used, it may be
possible for the service or the clients to take advantage of asynchronous features of the transport
(such as the non-blocking mode of a socket) to provide certain levels of asynchronous control.</p>
<h3 id="separation-of-protocol-and-transport"><a class="header" href="#separation-of-protocol-and-transport">Separation of Protocol and Transport</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol defines the format of messages, and some key characteristics and invariants
concerning their transmission between the service and its clients. It does not mandate a specific
transport stack. The wire protocol is a binary, stream-oriented protocol. As such, it can be carried
by any transport medium that supports the reliable transmission of binary octet streams, such as
Unix domain sockets (connected in streaming mode) or TCP sockets. Datagram-oriented transports are
<strong>not</strong> supported, because the protocol depends on the reliable transmission of entire messages in
the proper sequence.</p>
<h3 id="separation-of-header-and-body"><a class="header" href="#separation-of-header-and-body">Separation of Header and Body</a></h3>
<p>Every message (whether request or response) has a <strong>header</strong> and a <strong>body</strong>. Again, this is
conceptually similar to the separation of header and body in HTTP. And, like HTTP, this protocol
allows some flexibility in how the body content is encoded. The wire protocol borrows HTTP's notion
of the <strong>content-type</strong> and <strong>accept</strong> header fields, which allow the client to tell the server how
to interpret the content, and also to declare what kind of response is acceptable in return. The
only difference is that the wire protocol uses numerical byte fields to indicate these values, where
HTTP uses string key-value pairs and media types. This is another illustration of how the wire
protocol can be viewed as a more compact and stripped-down HTTP.</p>
<p>The message headers are <strong>fixed-length</strong> and <strong>fixed-format</strong>. The headers themselves have no
variability in their encoding, nor do they adhere to any encoding or serialization standard. The
format of the header is defined solely by this specification. When writing code to either transmit
or receive a header, the code must be written and validated according to this specification alone.
Headers are composed of a series of single-byte and multi-byte fields.</p>
<p>The header format is specified to be identical for requests and responses. Request and response
headers are of identical size, and have identical fields specified at identical offsets. This means
that developers only need to understand and code to a single header format. This design also means
that shared memory transport technologies can be used where the header resides in a single shared
buffer. However, this design does also means that some fields are redundant depending on the
context. A full specification of the byte fields for the header will be found later in this
document, including information about how and when they should be populated or interpreted.</p>
<p>Headers carry a fixed set of metadata fields that are common to all messages. However, they do not
carry any inputs to or outputs from specific API operations. API inputs and outputs are always
carried in the body. Unlike the header, which is always fixed-length and fixed-format, the body can
be both variable-length and variable-format.</p>
<h3 id="protobuf-body"><a class="header" href="#protobuf-body">Protobuf Body</a></h3>
<p>As described above, the wire protocol design allows for the message body to be structured and
encoded in a variety of formats. However, in current manifestations of the protocol, only a single
encoding is defined for use in the message bodies, and this encoding is based on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/"><strong>protocol
buffers</strong></a>, also known as <strong>protobuf</strong>.</p>
<p>For each operation in the API, two separate protobuf message definitions will exist: one for that
operation's inputs, and another for its outputs. The body in a request message can be converted
through protobuf-generated code into a model object for the inputs. Likewise, the body in a response
message can be converted through protobuf-generated code into a model object for the outputs.</p>
<p>Processing any message is, therefore, a two-phase process: firstly, the header must be processed by
writing code that is conformant with this specification; and secondly, the content must be processed
according to its content type, which is currently always protobuf.</p>
<p>Future manifestations of the wire protocol might support encoding schemes other than protobuf, in
which case the second phase of processing would differ. This is the reason why the protocol design
has granted some flexibility in terms of the message body encoding.</p>
<p>It is worth re-iterating that protobuf encodings are employed only for <em>message bodies</em> and not for
headers. As explained above, headers employ a bespoke binary encoding that is fully defined within
this specification alone. There is no use of protobuf within the header. Headers can be parsed and
generated only by writing code that conforms to this specification document. Again, this permits for
the possibility that a future manifesation might support different encoding schemes.</p>
<h3 id="authentication"><a class="header" href="#authentication">Authentication</a></h3>
<p>As described above, all messages in this protocol have a header and a body. If a message is a
request (as opposed to a response), then it will additionally carry a third component: its
<strong>authentication</strong> field.</p>
<p>The wire protocol is agnostic about how the authentication field is interpreted. The request header
measures the size of the field so that the service can consume the correct number of bytes from the
input stream. The request header also includes a one-byte integer label to inform the service how to
interpret the authentication bytes.</p>
<p>Authentication is based on the invariant that all client applications have access to a persistent
unique identifier. This is a string token that allows the assets and actions of one client to be
cleanly separated from those of another. But while this identifier string is the core component of
authentication, there are different ways that it can be used, and consequently there are different
ways for the authentication field to be populated. One simple method is for the client identifier to
be passed directly. But it is also possible to use the identifier as input to an HMAC algorithm over
the body, in which case the authentication field would contain the computed HMAC, rather than the
identifier itself.</p>
<p>See the <a href="parsec_client/api_overview.html#authentication-and-sessions">API Overview section</a> for a description of
possible authentication type values for the authentication field.</p>
<h3 id="sessions"><a class="header" href="#sessions">Sessions</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol supports the notion of sessions, which can be used to allow the client and the
service to track state across multiple API calls. The protocol allocates space within the request
header and the response header for an 8-byte session identifier. Details of how to create and manage
sessions are given in the API specification.</p>
<h3 id="wire-protocol-versions"><a class="header" href="#wire-protocol-versions">Wire Protocol Versions</a></h3>
<p>The wire protocol is versioned. It caters for situations where the service and its clients may be
operating at different versions. All messages (requests and responses) carry a major and minor
version number field. Although the design supports having different wire protocol versions, changes
are not expected to happen regularly, and they may not happen at all.</p>
<p>Clients can use the <a href="parsec_client/operations/ping.html">Ping</a> operation to determine what is the highest version of
the protocol that the service support and switch to that one if they want to. Requests made with a
wire protocol version not supported by the service will be sent back a
<code>WireProtocolVersionNotSupported</code> status code response.</p>
<p>Responses will be sent using the same wire protocol version than the requests they originate from.</p>
<p>Please note that the wire protocol version is <strong>not</strong> the mean of finding out the level of support
for specific operations in the API. The <a href="parsec_client/operations/list_opcodes.html">ListOpcodes</a> operation should
be used, per provider basis, to determine if an operation is supported by the provider.</p>
<h3 id="opcodes"><a class="header" href="#opcodes">Opcodes</a></h3>
<p>All requests contain an unsigned 4-byte integer field called the <strong>opcode</strong>. The opcode is the value
that determines which API operation is being invoked by the requests. Recall that each
request/response pair corresponds to the invocation of exactly one API operation, and each of these
operations is assigned an integer opcode.</p>
<p>The opcode zero is not used and is not valid. The lowest valid opcode is <code>0x0001</code>, and the highest
valid opcode is <code>0xFFFF</code>.</p>
<p>All <a href="parsec_client/operations#overview">opcodes</a> are defined within the API specification.</p>
<h3 id="status"><a class="header" href="#status">Status</a></h3>
<p>All responses contain an unsigned 2-byte integer field called the <strong>status</strong>, which is defined to
indicate the overall success or failure of the operation.</p>
<p>The status value of zero (<code>0x0000</code>) is used universally to mean that the operation completed
successfully.</p>
<p>With the exception of zero as a special case, other status values are partitioned according to the
same strategy as the opcodes. Status values from 1-999 are reserved for internal service
housekeeping operations, and status values from 1000-1999 are reserved for status codes
corresponding to the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Cryptography API.</p>
<p>All status values and their definition can be found on the <a href="parsec_client/status_codes.html"><strong>Status Codes</strong></a> page.</p>
<h2 id="message-structure-specifications"><a class="header" href="#message-structure-specifications">Message Structure Specifications</a></h2>
<h3 id="general-rules"><a class="header" href="#general-rules">General Rules</a></h3>
<p>This section provides a complete specification for the interpretation of messages. Based on this
specification, service and client code can be created to both consume and produce conformant
messages on any suitable transport medium.</p>
<p>All multi-byte numerical fields are transported in <strong>little-endian</strong> format: the least significant
byte is sent first.</p>
<h3 id="the-fixed-common-header"><a class="header" href="#the-fixed-common-header">The Fixed Common Header</a></h3>
<p>Requests and responses share a common fixed-format header whose specification is given below.
Because the header format is the same for requests and responses, it means that some of the data
fields in the header are unused/ignored depending on whether the header is an outgoing request
(being transmitted from the client to the service), or an incoming response (being returned from the
service back to the client). However, most fields are relevant and common to both.</p>
<p>Each field is annotated according to the following scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Common&quot; indicates that the field is common to both request messages and response messages.</li>
<li>&quot;Requests only&quot; indicates that the field is only used in requests and <strong>must</strong> be ignored in
responses. In a response, these fields should be set to a value of zero.</li>
<li>&quot;Responses only&quot; indicates that the field is only used in responses and <strong>must</strong> be ignored in
requests. In a request, these fields should be set to a value of zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields occur in contiguous memory and there must be no additional padding between them. On the
following diagram, the bytes go left to right from least significant to most significant.</p>

<p>When creating a new client library, please make sure you understand the <a href="parsec_client/../overview.html#beautiful-client-libraries">Parsec philosophy for
client libraries</a>. It is very important that you design
your client library to provide a highly ergonomic and idiomatic developer experience.</p>
<p>You will need to understand the <a href="parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> and the <a href="parsec_client/api_overview.html"><strong>API
specification</strong></a> in depth in order to create a client library.</p>
<p>You will need to know which <a href="parsec_client/../parsec_service/listeners.html"><code>Listener</code></a> the Parsec service is
currently using and how it was configured in order to communicate with it.</p>

need to be a whole number of blocks.</li>
<li><strong>ECB with no padding</strong>: The Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of a block cipher, with no padding.
The underlying block cipher is determined by the key type. <strong>Warning:</strong> ECB mode does not protect
the confidentiality of the encrypted data except in extremely narrow circumstances. It is
recommended that applications only use ECB if they need to construct an operating mode that the
implementation does not provide. Implementations are encouraged to provide the modes that
applications need in preference to supporting direct access to ECB.</li>
<li><strong>CBC with no padding</strong>: The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of a block cipher, with no padding.
The underlying block cipher is determined by the key type.</li>
<li><strong>CBC with PKCS#7 padding</strong>: The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of a block cipher, with PKCS#7
padding. The underlying block cipher is determined by the key type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aead-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#aead-algorithm">Aead algorithm</a></h3>
<p>Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD). The supported algorithms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CCM</strong>: the CCM authenticated encryption algorithm. The underlying block cipher is determined by
the key type.</li>
<li><strong>GCM</strong>: the GCM authenticated encryption algorithm. The underlying block cipher is determined by
the key type.</li>
<li><strong>ChaCha20-Poly1305</strong>: the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD algorithm. The ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction is
defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539.html">RFC 7539</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>AEAD algorithms with a shortened tag are also supported. An AEAD algorithm with a shortened tag is
similar to the corresponding AEAD algorithm, but has an authentication tag that consists of fewer
bytes. Depending on the algorithm, the tag length might affect the calculation of the ciphertext.</p>
<h3 id="asymmetricsignature-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#asymmetricsignature-algorithm">AsymmetricSignature algorithm</a></h3>
<p>Asymmetric signature algorithms. Supported algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature with hashing.</strong> This is the signature scheme defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017.html">RFC
8017</a> (PKCS#1: RSA Cryptography Specifications) under
the name <code>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</code>. Uses one of the hash algorithm supported.</li>
<li><strong>Raw PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.</strong> The input to this algorithm is the DigestInfo structure used by
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017.html">RFC 8017</a> §9.2 (PKCS#1: RSA Cryptography
Specifications), in steps 3–6.</li>
<li><strong>RSA PSS signature with hashing.</strong> This is the signature scheme defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017.html">RFC
8017</a> (PKCS#1: RSA Cryptography Specifications) under
the name RSASSA-PSS, with the message generation function MGF1, and with a salt length equal to
the length of the hash. The specified hash algorithm is used to hash the input message, to create
the salted hash, and for the mask generation. Uses one of the hash algorithm supported.</li>
<li><strong>ECDSA signature with hashing.</strong> This is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
defined by ANSI X9.62-2005, with a random per-message secret number (k). The representation of
the signature as a byte string consists of the concatenation of the signature values r and s.
Each of r and s is encoded as an N-octet string, where N is the length of the base point of the
curve in octets. Each value is represented in big-endian order, with the most significant octet
first. Uses one of the hash algorithm supported.</li>
<li><strong>ECDSA signature without hashing.</strong> This is the same signature scheme as above, but without
specifying a hash algorithm. This algorithm is only recommended to sign or verify a sequence of
bytes that are an already-calculated hash. Note that the input is padded with zeros on the left
or truncated on the left as required to fit the curve size.</li>
<li><strong>Deterministic ECDSA signature with hashing.</strong> This is the deterministic ECDSA signature scheme
defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979.html">RFC 6979</a>. Uses one of the hash algorithm
supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>When defining the permitted algorithms in a key policy, the hash-and-sign algorithms above can use
the value <strong>Any Hash</strong> for their hash algorithm, meaning that it will allow any hash algorithm. This
value must not be used to build an algorithm specification to perform an operation. It is only valid
to build policies.</p>

<p>The version triplet returned by this operation (<code>version_maj</code>, <code>version_min</code> and <code>version_rev</code>) is
the implementation version of the specific Parsec provider. For the Core Provider, this version is
the implementation version of the whole Parsec service.</p>
<p>The <code>providers</code> vector returned is in order of provider priority: the highest priority providers
come first. The core provider will always come last. The provider at position zero, if not the core
provider, can be treated as default provider by the client. Clients should still check the supported
opcodes of the provider, even the default one, as it might not implement the operations they want.</p>

recommended for use by applications, rather than plain encryption. If the application must perform a

<p>This page defines the mechanism-specific inputs and outputs of <code>PrepareKeyAttestation</code>. For an
in-depth look at the mechanisms and hardware tokens that we've considered, you can read our write-up
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jLLv8zN_xRunj9BEkk_L_tj5DiQOtkG/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each mechanism that needs preparation comes with its own definitions for
<code>PrepareKeyAttestationParams</code> and <code>PrepareKeyAttestationOutput</code>.</p>
<p><strong>(EXPERIMENTAL) The parameters for key attestation are in an experimental phase. No guarantees are
offered around the stability of the interface for any key attestation mechanism.</strong></p>
<h2 id="activatecredential-tpm-provider"><a class="header" href="#activatecredential-tpm-provider">ActivateCredential (TPM provider)</a></h2>
<p>The preparation necessary for <code>ActivateCredential</code> involves retrieving the data necessary for
performing the <code>TPM2_MakeCredential</code> computations outside of a TPM. The results from
<code>MakeCredential</code> can then be passed to <code>AttestKey</code>.</p>
<p>The service returns the TPM-specific name of the object to be attested, its public parameters, and
the public part of the attesting key. These three components can then be used by a 3rd party to
generate an encrypted credential to be used in <code>AttestKey</code>. The algorithm for protecting the
credential is defined in the <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part1_Architecture_pub.pdf">TPM 2.0 Architecture
spec</a>,
section B.10.4.</p>
<p>The public parameters of the key which will be attested are not strictly necessary in generating the
encrypted credential. The reason for its inclusion, however, rests on the need of the 3rd party to
verify that the object they are about to attest is indeed the one they expect. The process of
encrypting the credential involves deriving a symmetric key using the TPM-specific name of the
object to be attested. This name is obtained by performing a hash over the public parameters of the
object, and can thus be verified by the 3rd party if those parameters are available.</p>

<p>This operation performs a key attestation using a mechanism supported by the backend holding the
key. The purpose of the operation is to help a Parsec client provide proof to a 3rd party that some
key provisioned by the client is indeed stored and secured by a hardware backend. As such, the
operation is backed by native functionality in the hardware to attest to ownership of the key.</p>
<p>Given the wide variety of possible mechanisms, many of the properties, restrictions, and formats
involved are mechanism-dependent, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties of the attested key (e.g. whether it was created within the backend or imported)</li>
<li>Properties of the attesting key (e.g. if it must be able to sign or decrypt)</li>
<li>Number, content, and purpose of parameters required by the attestation</li>
<li>Contents and format of the output</li>
<li>Whether or not the attesting key can be specified</li>
</ul>
<p>All such characteristics are thoroughly described per mechanism on the <a href="parsec_client/operations/attest_key_params.html">key attestation parameters
page</a>.</p>
<p>All instances of backends that support <code>AttestKey</code> must be configured with a default, root key that
has been pre-provisioned and which can be used to produce attestations. This default attesting key
is selected by leaving the <code>attesting_key_name</code> empty. If the backend allows other keys to be used
for attesting, attestation chains can be created starting from the root key.</p>
<p><code>AttestKey</code> applies to asymmetric key pairs only.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part3_Commands_pub.pdf">TPM 2.0 Commands
spec</a>
describes the <code>TPM2_ActivateCredential</code> operation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command enables the association of a credential with an object in a way that ensures that the
TPM has validated the parameters of the credentialed object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>TPM2_ActivateCredential</code> allows a 3rd party to be assured of the protection of a key by means of an
encrypted credential. The 3rd party produces a random credential and encrypts it using the algorithm
defined in the <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part1_Architecture_pub.pdf">TPM 2.0 Architecture
spec</a>,
section B.10.4. The outputs of that algorithm (the encrypted and HMAC-protected credential, and a
secret seed encrypted with the public part of the attesting key) are sent to the Parsec service
which proceeds to perform the operation and returns the decrypted credential. The 3rd party can then
be certain that the key is protected by a TPM by confirming that the credential sent and the one
received are identical.</p>
<p>The computation mentioned previously relies on a number of parameters that must be obtained from the
Parsec service. As some of these parameters are strictly TPM-specific, they can be retrieved with
the <a href="parsec_client/operations/prepare_key_attestation.html"><code>PrepareKeyAttestation</code></a> operation. You can see how to perform the
preparation step for <code>ActivateCredential</code>
<a href="parsec_client/operations/prepare_key_attestation_params.html#activatecredential-tpm-provider">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This mechanisms is thus aimed at attesting keys that are configured for decryption</strong> (as opposed
to signing) and is of particular interest because the Endorsement Keys for which TPM manufacturers
produce certificates are overwhelmingly decryption keys.</p>
<p>The parameters and output follow the inputs and outputs of <code>TPM2_ActivateCredential</code> as defined in
the <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part2_Structures_pub.pdf">TPM 2.0 Structures

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the key interfaces and data flows within the service. It can be used in
combination with the <a href="parsec_service/source_code_structure.html"><strong>source code structure</strong></a> and <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a> documents to gain an understanding of how API
requests are received by the service and ultimately fulfilled by providers.</p>
<h2 id="data-flow-diagram"><a class="header" href="#data-flow-diagram">Data Flow Diagram</a></h2>
<p>The sections within this documentation are best understood with reference to the following data flow
diagram. The shaded areas below can also be used to cross-reference the data flow with the <a href="parsec_service/source_code_structure.html"><strong>source
code structure</strong></a> document, which can help with finding the relevant
definitions and implementations.</p>
<p><img src="parsec_service/diagrams/interfaces_and_dataflow.svg" alt="Data Flow Diagram" /></p>
<h2 id="the-data-flow-backbone"><a class="header" href="#the-data-flow-backbone">The Data Flow Backbone</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>data flow backbone</strong> refers to the overall flow of a single API request from a client
application, via the client library, through the IPC transport, through the service to a provider,
and then back again. It is captured by the bold red boxes in the flow diagram above. This
fundamental flow is common to all requests, no matter how they are fulfilled. Once a request hits a
back-end provider, it can be processed in an arbitrary number of different ways, using a combination
of hardware and software facilities provided by the target platform. However, the same fundamental
flow is always used to carry the request through the core parts of the service between the provider
and the client application.</p>
<p>There are at least two distinct processes involved in any API interaction: the client application
and the service. The architecture also supports out-of-process co-services that can be spawned as
child processes by the main service, making it possible for a full deployment to involve three or
even more distinct processes. Whenever data is transferred between processes, whether between the
client and the service, or between the service and a co-service, the same wire protocol
specification is always used to transfer the data as a serialized stream of bytes.</p>
<p>Out-of-process providers are supported in the architecture, but are not yet supported in the
implementation. The rationale for out-of-process providers is that it allows for them to be
developed in programming languages other than Rust.</p>
<p>This document concentrates on the data flows within the service. It does so by examining the role of
the key Rust objects, modules and interfaces, and the stages by which they process the request and
return the result.</p>
<h2 id="the-listener"><a class="header" href="#the-listener">The Listener</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Listener</code> is responsible for accepting incoming connections from clients on the transport
endpoint. This could take the form of a Unix domain socket listener. It is the only part of the
system that understands the form of transport being used. Its responsibility is to accept
connections and to produce streams capable of reading from and writing to the underlying connection.
The <code>Listener</code> does not perform any serialization or deserialization (marshalling) functions. It
deals only in connections and streams.</p>
<p>The <code>Listener</code> implements the <code>Listen</code> trait. Possible listeners are listed <a href="parsec_service/listeners.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-front-end-handler"><a class="header" href="#the-front-end-handler">The Front-End Handler</a></h2>
<p>Once an incoming byte stream has been obtained by the <code>Listener</code>, the stream is passed to the
<code>FrontEndHandler</code>, which is where the first phase of wire protocol interpretation is performed. The
<code>FrontEndHandler</code> is responsible for de-serializating the request header using the rules set out in
the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>FrontEndHandler</code> only de-serializes the request <em>header</em>. It does <em>not</em> serialize the request
<em>body</em>. The body content is processed at a later step. This means that the <code>FrontEndHandler</code> only
needs to understand the documented encoding scheme of the header format. It does not need to
understand protobuf or any other encoding scheme that might be employed for the body. The
<code>FrontEndHandler</code> makes use of the model objects and de-serialization support in the interface crate
to create a structured data model for the request. In this structured model, the request header
fields are all fully parsed, but the request body and authentication fields are still just arrays of
bytes.</p>
<h3 id="the-authenticator"><a class="header" href="#the-authenticator">The Authenticator</a></h3>
<p>Before the request is sent forward it must be authenticated. This involves the <code>FrontEndHandler</code>
choosing an appropriate <code>Authenticator</code> object from the set created at system startup, based on the
<code>AuthType</code> field in the request header. The <code>Authenticator</code> either returns an application name if
the authentication was successful, or an error value which is then returned to the client.</p>
<p>The <code>Authenticator</code> implements the <code>Authenticate</code> trait. Possible authenticators are listed
<a href="parsec_service/authenticators.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The partially-decoded request and application name are now sent to the <code>Dispatcher</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-dispatcher"><a class="header" href="#the-dispatcher">The Dispatcher</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Dispatcher</code> processes the <code>requests::Request</code> object, which represents a request with a
fully-parsed header, but an unparsed byte array for the body. Since the header is parsed, the
<code>Dispatcher</code> has access to all of the information that is needed to dispatch a request to the
appropriate back-end. This information includes the provider identifier, the body encoding type
(which is currently always <code>protobuf</code>, but in theory could be something else), and the protocol
version major and minor fields.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the <code>Dispatcher</code> is to loop over the available <code>BackEndHandler</code>s in order to
find one that is capable of servicing the request.</p>
<p>Aside from selecting a suitable <code>BackEndHandler</code>, the <code>Dispatcher</code> does not perform any additional
processing of the request. It is passed to the next stage still in the form of the
<code>requests::Request</code> structure, which contains the parsed header fields and the unparsed body.</p>
<p>The next stage of processing is a branch point. The service contains only a single <code>Dispatcher</code>, but
there are multiple <code>BackEndHandler</code>s. The <code>Dispatcher</code> is informed about the available handlers via
a registration mechanism that executes at service start-up.</p>
<h2 id="the-back-end-handler"><a class="header" href="#the-back-end-handler">The Back-End Handler</a></h2>
<p>The <code>BackEndHandler</code> accepts the request in order to route it to its associated provider. The flow
differs here depending on whether the provider is an in-process Rust <code>Provider</code> object, or a
provider residing in an out-of-process co-server. If the provider is in a co-server, the
<code>BackEndHandler</code> will use the wire protocol to re-serialize the request and transmit it to the
co-server's transport endpoint, where it will then block in order to wait for a response. The onward
flow within the co-server is beyond the scope of this document, since co-servers can have arbitrary
implementations.</p>
<p>Assuming that the provider is an in-process Rust <code>Provider</code> object, the <code>BackEndHandler</code> will
fully-decode the request in order to turn it into a model object from the <code>operations</code> module. These
model objects are named <code>Operation</code> and are namespaced with the operation name module such as
<code>operations::list_opcodes::Operation</code>. Once the operation model has been constructed, it is executed
on the <code>Provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-converter"><a class="header" href="#the-converter">The Converter</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Converter</code> in the interface crate is responsible to deserialize the body of the request to an
operation from the <code>operations</code> module or to serialize a result to a response body. There is one
<code>Converter</code> per format of operation contracts. <code>protobuf</code> converter is currently implemented in the
interface.</p>
<p>The <code>Converter</code> implements the <code>Convert</code> trait. Possible converters are listed
<a href="parsec_service/converters.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-provider"><a class="header" href="#the-provider">The Provider</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Provider</code> is where the request is fulfilled using whatever combined software and hardware stack
it has been coded for. The service can support any number of providers to interact with platform
facilities such as TPM, HSM or TA. The provider does whatever is necessary to implement the
operation. It then returns a result. Results are also communicated using model objects from the
<code>operations</code> module. These are named <code>Result</code>, namespaced with the operation name module such as
<code>operations::psa_import_key::Result</code>. This is where the data flow changes direction and begins its
return journey to the client application. For a more detailed description of the current providers,
see the <a href="parsec_service/providers.html"><strong>Providers</strong></a> page.</p>
<p>The <code>Provider</code> implements the <code>Provide</code> trait.</p>
<h3 id="the-key-info-manager"><a class="header" href="#the-key-info-manager">The Key Info Manager</a></h3>
<p>Providers may make use of Key Info Managers to persistently and safely store key information
material, and thus another step for conversion from key name to provider-specific identifier is
needed.</p>
<p>The <code>KeyInfoManager</code> implements the <code>ManageKeyInfo</code> trait. Possible key info managers are listed
<a href="parsec_service/key_info_managers.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="return-journey"><a class="header" href="#return-journey">Return Journey</a></h2>
<p>The return journey is a mirror-image of what has been described above, except that there is no
dispatch phase (because the provider has already been chosen). The result is handled by the
<code>BackEndHandler</code>, which uses the correct encoding scheme (currently always protobuf) to serialize
the operation outputs into a new <code>requests::Response</code> struct. It also populates the response header
fields.</p>
<p>The <code>Response</code> is passed directly back from the <code>Dispatcher</code> to the <code>FrontEndHandler</code>, which uses
the rules of the wire protocol to transform the response header into a byte stream that can be
concatenated with the operation outputs that were already serialized in the above step. Again, it
makes use of serialization functions in the <code>interface</code> crate to serialize the header.</p>
<p>The response, at this stage, is now simply a sequence of bytes, which can be written back to the
transport endpoint by the <code>FrontEndHandler</code>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<h2 id="audience-2"><a class="header" href="#audience-2">Audience</a></h2>
<p>An understanding of the source code repository structure is essential for developers who are
contributing functionality to the service or any of its client libraries.</p>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This project is a client-server system. It is composed of a service which exposes an API to clients
that reside in separate processes on the same host. An IPC mechanism is defined to allow these
external client processes to call the API in any programming language. This project maintains client
libraries for a number of popular programming languages. The service itself is written in the
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> programming language. The API provides access to platform security
facilities for key management and cryptography. Client applications call the API in order to access
these facilities without needing to know about the underlying platform hardware. The service
fulfills the operations by routing them to whatever platform facilities are available, such as a
Hardware Security Module (HSM), Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or Trusted Application (TA).</p>
<p>The API is closely aligned with the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf">Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Crypto
API</a>.
PSA Crypto is specifically a C interface. This project takes the operations of that C interface and
wraps each of them in an IPC <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html">wire protocol</a>. There is
intentionally a very close correspondence between the two APIs, and the contracts of the operations
are identical in the majority of cases. However, the service also exposes a number of new operations
that are designed to help clients consume it more easily.</p>
<p>The Parsec project is organized over <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond">multiple repositories</a>. The
remainder of the document will examine the contents of some of these.</p>
<h2 id="the-parsec-repository"><a class="header" href="#the-parsec-repository">The Parsec Repository</a></h2>
<p>The <code>parsec</code> repository contains the code for the service. The service is written in
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org"><strong>Rust</strong></a>. Rust projects are organized into modular units known as
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html"><strong>crates</strong></a>,
each of which is formed of one or more
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html"><strong>modules</strong></a>,
which are built using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html"><strong>Cargo</strong></a>
build system. A Rust crate can be compiled into either a library or an executable. The service is
composed of a series of modules - represented by folders - defining the major components of the
system.</p>
<p>The <code>src/bin</code> directory defines the executable which links all the components together and runs the
main loop of the service.</p>
<p>The <code>front</code> module houses the code for the front-end functionality of the service. The front-end is
responsible for listening on the endpoint, such as a domain socket, and using the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html">wire
protocol</a> to read and interpret API requests from clients. The
front-end is also responsible for serializing responses according to the same wire protocol, in
order to relay them back to the calling client.</p>
<p>The <code>back</code> module is responsible for routing client API requests to a back-end <strong>provider</strong>. A
provider is a module that knows how to fulfill a request using available platform facilities such as
HSM, TPM, TA or software. The service can be linked against one or more providers. The back-end
module could evolve to include a registration mechanism that allows the providers to announce their
presence in the overall system. There is also a dispatch mechanism that allows each incoming request
to be routed to the appropriate provider. The provider is instructed to perform the operation, and
the results are marshalled back to the front-end for onward serialization and return to the client.</p>
<p>The <code>authenticators</code> module contains the components that carry out the authentication of incoming
requests. Depending on the <code>auth_type</code> specified in the request header, the appropriate
authenticator is selected to parse and assess the <code>authentication</code> request field. The result is
either an error or the identifier of the application sending the request. Authenticators may use the
underlying security hardware to determine if the request has been correctly authenticated. For a
more detailed description of authentication and application identity, see the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/api_overview.html"><strong>API
overview</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>key_info_managers</code> module offers functionality for the providers for persisting mappings
between key names and provider-specific key information. The key info managers close the gap between
the API, which allows keys to be addressed by a UTF-8 name, and the providers which have specific
requirements for key handles (e.g. Mbed Crypto uses a 32 bit value for handles of persistent keys).
Using a key info manager is only required for persistent keys and the only current implementation
stores the mappings on disk.</p>
<p>The <code>utils</code> module contain various components like the service builder and the global configuration
mechanism.</p>
<p>Building the service will combine the frontend and backend components mentioned above into one
executable. It also links additional Rust crates that contain the providers, as well as crates to
support the IPC interface. On Linux systems, this binary runs as a daemon. While it is running,
client applications (on the same host) can locate the endpoint and make API calls.</p>
<h3 id="the-providers-sub-folder"><a class="header" href="#the-providers-sub-folder">The Providers Sub-Folder</a></h3>
<p>The <code>src/providers</code> folder contains the provider modules, which connect the service back-end with
the hardware or software security facilities of supported target platforms.</p>
<p>Currently each provider sits in its own module implementing all the functionality needed to mediate
between the PSA interface and the platform it supports. This generally involves two types of
mediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>process convergence: the code implementing the operation calls is geared towards executing
identical cryptographic operations using different APIs; this can include functionality that is
not directly related to the desired operation (e.g. setting up sessions, managing key material
etc.).</li>
<li>data convergence: data passed into and returned from every operation should be
provider-independent; however, APIs can and tend to have differing ways of describing algorithms,
schemes, response codes and so on, and thus require conversion utilities; a similar, tangential
issue is that of encoding formats used or expected by underlying APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="parsec_service/providers.html">Providers</a> can be conditionally linked into the service as described in the <a href="parsec_service/build_run.html">Parsec
build</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The <code>providers</code> folder is also a key extension point for partner contributors. This project eagerly
welcomes contributions of new providers in order to connect the service with the security facilities
of host platforms and extend the ecosystem.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for providers to be written in Rust. A provider must be written in Rust in order
to be statically linked into the core service and hence to reside within the same running process.
But the architecture also supports providers running as separate processes. These providers can be
written in any suitable programming language. This will be an option to consider if you wish to
contribute a new back-end provider, but you wish to use a programming language other than Rust.
Currently the service implementation does not offer this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="the-interface-repository"><a class="header" href="#the-interface-repository">The Interface Repository</a></h2>
<p>The <code>parsec-interface</code> crate contains the Rust code that is needed to allow the service to conform
to the interface and wire protocol. It is also used by the Rust client library, but it is not used
by other client libraries (since those are written in other languages).</p>
<p>The crate contains three Rust modules: <code>requests</code>, <code>operations</code> and <code>operations_protobuf</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>requests</code> module defines model objects for request and response headers as described in the
wire protocol specification. It also contains the Rust code needed to serialize and de-serialize
these header structures (a process sometimes known as <em>marshalling</em>). This code is hand-written and
verified according to the written specification. It is not auto-generated, and it is unrelated to
the protobuf API contracts. The <code>requests</code> module functions according to the wire protocol
specification, regardless of whether protobuf is used in request body. This leaves the door open for
supporting schemes other than protobuf in the future.</p>
<p>The <code>operations</code> module defines model objects for each of the operations in the API. Again, these
definitions are independent of protobuf so that encoding schemes other than protobuf can be adopted
if needed. The Rust structs in the operations module capture the specific inputs and outputs for
each API operation. Those operations being based on the PSA Crypto API, a lot of types used in the
<code>operations</code> module are directly taken from the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto"><code>psa-crypto</code></a> crate.</p>
<p>The <code>operations_protobuf</code> module provides compatibility between the protobuf contracts and the
equivalent model objects in the <code>operations</code> module. Auto-generated code is generated from the
protobuf contracts at build-time, and is injected into this module, alongside hand-written
converters that translate to and from the <code>operations</code> structs. This extra level of translation may
seem cumbersome, but it is important in order to isolate the use of protobuf from the rest of the
system, so that a different encoding scheme could be adopted in the future without affecting
anything else. Most of the service uses the <code>operations</code> module to model API operations and their
results.</p>
<h2 id="the-operations-repository"><a class="header" href="#the-operations-repository">The Operations Repository</a></h2>
<p>The <code>protobuf</code> folder in the <code>parsec-operations</code> repository contains the language-neutral input and
output contracts of all of the operations that are supported in the API. This includes all of the
operations derived from the PSA Crypto API Specification, as well as additional operations that are
specific to this service. All of these contracts are defined using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/"><strong>protocol
buffers</strong></a>, also known as <strong>protobuf</strong>. Refer to
the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> for more details on the use
of protobuf. The protobuf contracts are programming-language-agnostic, and can be used to develop
interoperable code within both the service and the client.</p>
<p>The API is a collection of <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/operations"><strong>operations</strong></a>. Each operation is denoted
by an integer <strong>opcode</strong>, an <strong>input contract</strong> and an <strong>output contract</strong>. Each input contract and
output contract is defined using a protobuf <strong>message</strong> structure. These messages collect together
the inputs and outputs of each operation. The messages can be used in combination with a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf"><strong>protobuf
compiler</strong></a> tool to generate language bindings for
these inputs and outputs. A client library uses these bindings alongside code derived from the
<a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> in order to create a complete
language binding for the API.</p>
<h2 id="the-client-repositories"><a class="header" href="#the-client-repositories">The Client Repositories</a></h2>
<p>Client libraries are expected to reside in independent repositories, most likely inheriting the
<strong>protobuf</strong> contracts from the <code>parsec-operations</code> repository. Each client library is subject to
its own sub-structure, build system and documentation system underneath that. The structures and
build systems will naturally vary from one language to another, and these are not governed by the
project overall.</p>
<p>This project eagerly welcomes contributions of new client libraries in different programming
languages in order to enhance the ecosystem and increase adoption. The <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_users.html"><code>Parsec for users</code></a> page contains a list of currently available client libraries.</p>

<p>The <code>auth_type</code> field in the configuration allows to change the authenticator currently used by

<h2 id="unix-peer-credentials-authenticator"><a class="header" href="#unix-peer-credentials-authenticator">Unix Peer Credentials Authenticator</a></h2>
<p>The Unix peer credentials authenticator uses Unix peer credentials to authenticate the clients as
different Unix users. Here 'Unix peer credentials' refers to metadata about the connection between
client and server that contains the effective Unix user identifier (UID) and Unix group identifier
(GID) of the connecting process.</p>
<p>To use this authenticator, the application must self-declare its UID (<strong>not</strong> username) in the
authentication field of the request as a zero-padded little-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. This
authenticator will then verify that the UID sourced from the peer credentials matches the one
self-declared in the request. If they match up, authentication is successful and the application
identity is set to the UID.</p>
<p>Note that a Unix domain socket transport is not limited to the Unix peer credentials authenticator;
this transport can be used with a different authenticator if required.</p>
<p>The GID and PID components of the Unix peer credentials are currently unused by the peer credentials
authenticator.</p>
<h2 id="jwt-spiffe-verifiable-identity-document-authenticator"><a class="header" href="#jwt-spiffe-verifiable-identity-document-authenticator">JWT SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document Authenticator</a></h2>
<p>The JWT-SVID authenticator uses the JWT-SVID token to authenticate clients. The SPIFFE ID contained

about the structure of the JWT-SVID token.</p>
<p>The token is passed in the authentication field using the JWS Compact Serialization.</p>
<p>The SPIFFE Workload API is used by clients to fetch their JWT-SVID token and by the service to
verify it. Its <code>aud</code> claim (audience) must be set to <code>parsec</code>. A low expiration time is recommended
through the <code>exp</code> claim.</p>

<p><strong>Provider UUID: 47049873-2a43-4845-9d72-831eab668784</strong></p>
<p>The core provider is a non-cryptographic provider, tasked with storing and distributing both static
and dynamic information about the service. It is the base for service discovery, helping clients
identify what functionality is available.</p>
<p>One instance of the core provider must always be running with a provider ID of zero (<code>0x00</code>).</p>
<h2 id="mbed-crypto-provider"><a class="header" href="#mbed-crypto-provider">Mbed Crypto Provider</a></h2>
<p><strong>Provider UUID: 1c1139dc-ad7c-47dc-ad6b-db6fdb466552</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.9/apis/mbed-crypto.html">Mbed Crypto</a> provider is a
software-based provider built on top of Mbed Crypto - the reference implementation of the PSA
cryptography specification. Mbed Crypto is loaded as a static library and executes with the rest of
the service in user-space.</p>
<p>As a software provider, Mbed Crypto does not offer the same security guarantees as other
hardware-based providers and does not store its keys in a secure location in hardware, but directly
on disk. Because of that, the Mbed Crypto provider should not be used securely for private key
operations but can be used to simplify proof of concept projects. It is also worth noting that the
Mbed Crypto library stores persistent keys (i.e. all keys produced via Parsec) in the working
directory of the service. Thus, take precautions if you would like to provide some level of security
to the stored keys, or if you wish to ensure they are persisted across reboots - these extra
considerations should be directed at the working directory of the Parsec service.</p>
<h2 id="tpm-provider"><a class="header" href="#tpm-provider">TPM Provider</a></h2>
<p><strong>Provider UUID: 1e4954a4-ff21-46d3-ab0c-661eeb667e1d</strong></p>
<p>The TPM provider offers an abstraction over hardware (or software) Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)
version 2. It uses the TPM2 Software Stack <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-tss-2-0-enhanced-system-api-esapi-specification/">Enhanced System
API</a>
to communicate with the TPM and thus requires the TSS libraries to be on the machine.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation guide</a> to
install the TSS libraries. To use the &quot;device&quot; TCTI, the user running Parsec will need to have
access rights on <code>/dev/tpm0</code> and <code>/dev/tpmrm0</code>. For that matter, installing the udev rules is needed
and the user running Parsec will need to be in the <code>tss</code> group.</p>
<p>The provider operates with keys based in the Owner Hierarchy. Thus, Parsec needs to be able to
authenticate with the TPM and to create a primary key and children keys derived from the primary.
Given current constraints, only one request at a time can be serviced by this provider - the rest
being blocked, waiting their turn.</p>

<p><strong>Provider UUID: 30e39502-eba6-4d60-a4af-c518b7f5e38f</strong></p>
<p>The PKCS11 provider is a wrapper around the PKCS 11 standard interface, capable of working with
software or hardware modules that expose this API. Linking is done dynamically, and requires a
library that can drive the crypto engine.</p>
<p>Connecting to the PKCS11 module requires a slot number and, ideally, a PIN number that secures the
slot.</p>

<p>Creating new providers means enabling Parsec to work on new platforms and is one of the main goals
of the project. As such, the interface that must be implemented by each provider was built with
modularity in mind, allowing developers to choose which operations they implement and when. This
interface is represented by a Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html"><code>trait</code></a> -
more precisely, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/parsec-service/latest/parsec_service/providers/trait.Provide.html"><code>Provide</code></a>
trait.</p>
<p>The full list of operations that can be implemented can be found in the link above and will be
expanded as the project progresses towards supporting more use cases.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-methods"><a class="header" href="#mandatory-methods">Mandatory methods</a></h2>
<p>Some <code>Provide</code> trait methods are mandatory for the service to behave normally. They are used on a
service-level by the core provider and so must be supported by all providers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>describe</code>: Each provider must offer a description of itself in the shape of a
<a href="https://docs.rs/parsec-interface/latest/parsec_interface/operations/list_providers/struct.ProviderInfo.html"><code>ProviderInfo</code></a>
value, by implementing the <code>describe</code> method. The UUID identifying the provider is
developer-generated and should not clash with existing providers. This process also requires the
new provider to be added to the
<a href="https://docs.rs/parsec-interface/0.25.0/parsec_interface/requests/enum.ProviderId.html"><code>ProviderID</code></a>
enum. The <code>describe</code> method is also used to return the supported opcodes by the provider.</li>
<li><code>list_keys</code>: the provider must implement this method to return all the keys stored within the
provider for a particular application name.</li>
<li><code>list_clients</code>: the provider must implement this method to return the application names that have
data stored within the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>list_keys</code> and <code>list_clients</code> can often be implemented by directly using the
<code>KeyInfoManagerClient</code>.</p>
<h2 id="data-format"><a class="header" href="#data-format">Data format</a></h2>
<p>Lots of care must be taken when implementing operations that the inputs and outputs are in the
correct format, especially in the case of byte arrays. Detailed description of all input and output
can be found in the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_client/operations">operations documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-management-1"><a class="header" href="#key-management-1">Key management</a></h2>
<p>A helpful utility that the Parsec service offers to providers is the use of key info managers. These
allow the provider to persist mappings between key names and key information material and is
generally needed since providers are expected to support UTF-8 encoded strings as key names. To use
the KeyInfoManager in a thread-safe and convenient way, the KeyInfoManagerClient structure can be
used. The key ID type used will have to implement <code>serde</code> <code>Serialize</code> and <code>DeserializedOwned</code>
traits.</p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-key-identity-mappings-coherency"><a class="header" href="#dealing-with-key-identity-mappings-coherency">Dealing with key identity mappings coherency</a></h3>
<p>During the lifetime of the Parsec service, it might happen that the mappings do not correctly
reflect the state of the actual key store: a key stored in the KeyInfoManager does not map to any
key in the keystore backend. Providers should implement the following policies to prevent that.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the provider construction, fetch all key infos linked to that provider. For each one of
them, get the associated ID and issue one command to the backend to check if a key with that ID
exists. If it does not, add the key to a <code>to_delete</code> list and then delete all the mappings in the
<code>to_delete</code> list. Check the existing providers' constructors for an example.</li>
<li>Follow the algorithm described in the documentation of <code>psa_generate_key</code>, <code>psa_import_key</code> and
<code>psa_destroy_key</code> when implementing those <code>Provide</code> methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of those policies is to make sure, in a best-effort way, that key management operations
have the behavior wanted: it is possible to create a key with the same name if the key
creation/deletion operation failed and that at any given time only valid keys can be used.</p>
<p>Because of those policies focused on clients' convenience, it might be possible that some keys
become &quot;zombies&quot; in the keystore: they can no longer be accessed via Parsec but still exist.</p>
<p>Please also note that those policies do not protect against hardware attacks. In our threat model is
documented as an assumption (ASUM-1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hardware modules are physically and functionally secure. Only trusted agents can physically
access the system.</p>

<p>This project is coded in the Rust Programming Language. To build it, you first need to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">install
Rust</a>.</p>
<p>Some Parsec backends require FFI binding code to be generated, to allow us to interface with the
libraries driving the hardware. For this we use <code>bindgen</code> and generate the Rust to C wrappers, for
which <code>libclang</code> (version at least 3.9) is needed:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install llvm-dev libclang-dev clang cmake
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-parsec"><a class="header" href="#building-parsec">Building Parsec</a></h2>
<p>Because the <a href="parsec_service/providers.html">providers</a> and <a href="parsec_service/authenticators.html">authenticators</a> supported by Parsec
are dependent on libraries and/or hardware features present on the platform, the build is fragmented
through Rust features so that the resulting binary only contains the desired providers. Currently
the service provides some of the following features: <code>mbed-crypto-provider</code>, <code>pkcs11-provider</code>,
<code>tpm-provider</code>, <code>cryptoauthlib-provider</code>, <code>trusted-service-provider</code>, as well as
<code>jwt-svid-authenticator</code>. Please check the <a href="parsec_service/build_run.html#dependencies">dependencies</a> for what is needed to build
each provider.</p>
<p>The <code>mbed-crypto-provider</code> feature is going to be used as an example in this guide. This can be
replaced by a subset of the features mentioned above, space or comma separated. If you would like to
test the TPM or PKCS check the <a href="parsec_service/tests#testing-the-tpm-provider-using-the-software-tpm">related
guides</a>.</p>
<p>On a real deployment (as explained in our <a href="parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html">installation guide</a>) specific
owners and permissions need to be set up on multiple folders. For testing only, it is fine to run
Parsec from the current directory, have the key information mappings in <code>./mappings</code> and the socket
at <code>/tmp/parsec.sock</code>. The test configuration will make those choices.</p>
<p>Clone the Parsec service repo,</p>
<pre><code>git clone --branch 1.2.0 https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec.git
</code></pre>
<p>Having cloned the Parsec repository, to build and run from source using the Mbed Crypto provider and
the test configuration:</p>
<pre><code>cd parsec
cargo build --features &quot;mbed-crypto-provider,direct-authenticator&quot;
RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/parsec -c e2e_tests/provider_cfg/mbed-crypto/config.toml
</code></pre>
<p><code>parsec</code> will then construct the service based on the <a href="parsec_service/configuration.html">configuration</a> file and
wait for clients.</p>
<p>At the end of initialization, it should print <code>Parsec is ready</code> which means that it is ready to take

<h2 id="dependencies"><a class="header" href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Each provider has external dependencies that are needed to compile. Additionally, the JWT SVID
authenticator also relies on external dependencies being present.</p>
<h3 id="mbed-crypto"><a class="header" href="#mbed-crypto">Mbed Crypto</a></h3>
<p>The Mbed Crypto provider is built on top of the reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography
API. You can find a list of dependencies
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/tree/master/psa-crypto-sys">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pkcs-11-crypto"><a class="header" href="#pkcs-11-crypto">PKCS 11 Crypto</a></h3>
<p>The PKCS 11 provider will try to dynamically load the library indicated in the configuration file,
hence a library implementing the PKCS 11 API is needed.</p>
<h3 id="tpm-crypto"><a class="header" href="#tpm-crypto">TPM Crypto</a></h3>
<p>The TPM provider will try to build the <code>tss-esapi</code> crate which needs built TSS 2.0 esys and tctildr
libraries. It will use <code>pkg-config</code> to find them using the names <code>tss2-esys</code> and <code>tss2-tctildr</code>.
Make sure you also follow the requirements of the <a href="https://docs.rs/tss-esapi">tss-esapi crate</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoauth-library"><a class="header" href="#cryptoauth-library">CryptoAuth Library</a></h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3 id="trusted-service"><a class="header" href="#trusted-service">Trusted Service</a></h3>
<p>The Trusted Service provider connects to its backend through the shared library produced by the
<a href="https://trusted-services.readthedocs.io/en/integration/deployments/index.html"><code>libts</code> deployment</a>.
You can find instructions for building the required components
<a href="https://trusted-services.readthedocs.io/en/integration/developer/build-instructions.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Trusted Service provider also relies on the <code>protoc</code> command to be available on the <code>PATH</code>. This
is needed as our method of IPC with the TS relies on protobuf. On Ubuntu-like distributions, it can
be installed via the package manager under the name <code>protobuf-compiler</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
</code></pre>
<h2 id="cross-compilation"><a class="header" href="#cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</a></h2>
<p>The Parsec service can be cross-compiled to other target triplets. You might need to install a
cross-compilation C toolchain for the target you want to compile for. The default ones are indicated
in the <code>.cargo/config</code> file.</p>

<p>Parsec can be built and installed as a Linux daemon using systemd. The daemon is a systemd user
daemon run by the <code>parsec</code> user. Some manual steps are needed to make sure that permissions are set
up correctly so that Parsec is installed respecting the operational mitigations of our <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.html">threat
model</a>.</p>
<p>If your Linux system uses systemd to manage daemons, you can follow these steps. <code>$DESIRED_FEATURES</code>
can be a space or comma-separated subset of <code>*-provider</code> and <code>*-authenticator</code> features. Choose the
providers you want to install depending on what is available on the platform. Only one authenticator
can be chosen at runtime, the Unix Peer Credentials one is compiled in by default.</p>
<p>This guide will assume that an authenticator is used. If you wish to install Parsec with Direct
Authentication and mutually trusted clients, please follow this guide first and then go to the
<a href="parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html#using-direct-authentication">dedicated section</a> for the subsequent steps. You will need to add the
<code>direct-authenticator</code> feature to your <code>$DESIRED_FEATURES</code> variable.</p>
<h2 id="from-an-admin-user-with-privileges"><a class="header" href="#from-an-admin-user-with-privileges">From an admin user with privileges</a></h2>
<p>Create the <code>parsec</code> user with a strong password.</p>
<pre><code>sudo useradd -m parsec
sudo passwd parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Create the following Parsec directories, with good permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/var/lib/parsec</code> for storing persistent data like the <code>mappings</code> folder.</li>
<li><code>/etc/parsec</code> to contain the configuration file.</li>
<li><code>/usr/libexec/parsec</code> to contain the <code>parsec</code> executable binary file.</li>
<li><code>/run/parsec</code> to contain the socket file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /var/lib/parsec
sudo chown parsec /var/lib/parsec
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/parsec
sudo mkdir /etc/parsec
sudo chown parsec /etc/parsec
sudo chmod 700 /etc/parsec
sudo mkdir /usr/libexec/parsec
sudo chown parsec /usr/libexec/parsec

<h2 id="from-the-parsec-user"><a class="header" href="#from-the-parsec-user">From the parsec user</a></h2>
<p>Log in to <code>parsec</code>.</p>
<pre><code>su --login parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on which features of Parsec the <code>parsec</code> user is going to use, it might need to be given
more privileges in order to access some resources on the system. Refer to the
<a href="parsec_service/providers.html">Providers</a> page for more information.</p>
<p>In its home directory, clone and compile Parsec. If a Rust toolchain is not available widely on the
system, it will need to be <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">installed</a> for that specific
user.</p>
<p>Below is an example with Parsec 0.6.0, update with the version you want!</p>
<pre><code>git clone --branch 0.6.0 https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec
cargo build --manifest-path parsec/Cargo.toml --features $DESIRED_FEATURES --release
cp parsec/target/release/parsec /usr/libexec/parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Adapt and copy the <a href="parsec_service/configuration.html">configuration</a> you want to use. Particulary, add and configure
the providers you set in the <code>$DESIRED_FEATURES</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cp parsec/config.toml /etc/parsec/config.toml
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> do not set <code>&quot;Direct&quot;</code> for <code>auth_type</code> as this will make Parsec insecure. If you would
like to use Direct Authentication with mutually trusted clients, please continue the steps described
below and then go to the <a href="parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html#using-direct-authentication">dedicated section</a>.</p>
<p>Install the systemd unit files and activate the Parsec socket.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp -r parsec/systemd-daemon/parsec.service ~/.config/systemd/user
systemctl --user enable parsec
systemctl --user start parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Check the Parsec logs with:</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --user -u parsec
</code></pre>
<p>If later you change the configuration file, you can reload the service with:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user kill -s HUP parsec
</code></pre>
<h2 id="from-a-parsec-client"><a class="header" href="#from-a-parsec-client">From a Parsec client</a></h2>
<p>The definition of a client will depend on the <a href="parsec_service/authenticators.html">authenticator</a> that you configured
Parsec with.</p>
<p>Clients can now use Parsec! They can test it by installing the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-tool"><code>parsec-tool</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ parsec-tool ping
[INFO] Pinging Parsec service...
[SUCCESS] Service wire protocol version is 1.0.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-direct-authentication"><a class="header" href="#using-direct-authentication">Using Direct Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Using this authentication method, clients will be able to declare their own identity. Clients using
Parsec with this authentication need to be mutually trusted and part of the <code>parsec-clients</code> group.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> you must only follow those steps if Parsec is not currently storing any keys.</p>
<p>As the <code>parsec</code> user, stop the service.</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user stop parsec
</code></pre>
<p>As the admin, add the <code>parsec-clients</code> group and restrict the visibility of the socket folder to
that group.</p>
<pre><code>sudo groupadd parsec-clients
sudo chown parsec:parsec-clients /run/parsec
sudo chmod 750 /run/parsec
</code></pre>
<p>Add mutually trusted clients to the <code>parsec-clients</code> group. For example, adding the imaginary
<code>parsec-client-1</code> user to the <code>parsec-clients</code> group:</p>
<pre><code>sudo usermod -a -G parsec-clients parsec-client-1
</code></pre>
<p>Users just added to that group might need to log-out and log-in again to make sure the change apply.
They can also try the <code>newgrp</code> command with no parameters to re-initialize their environment.</p>
<p>Modify the <code>auth_type</code> in <code>/etc/parsec</code> to <code>&quot;Direct&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[authenticator]
auth_type = &quot;Direct&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>As the <code>parsec</code> user, start the service again.</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user start parsec
</code></pre>
<p><code>parsec-clients</code> users can now use Parsec! You can test it (having logged in a <code>parsec-clients</code>
user) by installing the <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-tool"><code>parsec-tool</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ parsec-tool ping

<p>Parsec relies on a mix of unit, end-to-end, integration, stress and fuzz tests. Unit tests are
usually found in the same module as the code they verify. End-to-end and stress tests can be found
in the <code>e2e_tests</code> directory (along with the code framework required for running them), and come in
two flavours: single-provider and all-providers. Integration tests are found in the <code>tests</code>
directory and test the public module that the <code>parsec-service</code> crate exports.</p>
<p>Single-provider tests do a thorough verification of each individual provider, while all-providers
tests check that the common functionality is capable of supporting multiple providers at the same
time. Another subcategory of integration tests are persistance tests which check that key material
is persisted through service restarts.</p>
<p>The stress test simply constructs and sends random requests as fast as possible using a
multithreaded client. Valid requests are sent intermittently so as to check that the service is
still up and working correctly.</p>
<p>The <code>ci.sh</code> script executes all tests and is used on the CI.</p>
<p>Parsec's code style is enforced by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt"><code>rustfmt</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy"><code>clippy</code></a>, which are needed for code formatting and
static lint checks respectively. A documentation style is also enforced by <code>cargo test --doc</code>.</p>
<p>You can see a (partial) code coverage figure <a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/parallaxsecond/parsec">here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>partial because only a subset of the tests can be run with the code coverage instrumentation
enabled.</li>

<p>Fuzz testing works, at the moment, on a service level, generating random requests and sending them
to be processed. Running the fuzz tests can be done through the <code>fuzz.sh</code> script in the root of the
repository. <code>./fuzz.sh run</code> builds a Docker image where the fuzz tests will run. It then sets up the
environment and initiates the test in the container. The fuzzing engine
(<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a>) works by generating random inputs for a fuzzing
target and then observing the code segments reached using said input. To stop the fuzzer, simply run
<code>./fuzz.sh stop</code>. To view the logs of a currently executing fuzzer, run <code>./fuzz.sh follow</code>. Any
crashes or slow tests, as well as tests that lead to a timeout, are stored in
<code>./fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_service/</code>.</p>

<p>If you do not have a hardware TPM, or you do not want to use it for tests, you might want to use the
IBM Software TPM. You will need to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>install the TSS libraries (<a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation
guide</a>). Parsec has been tested
with version 2.3.3.</li>
<li>install the <a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools">TPM tools</a>. Parsec has been tested with
version 4.1.</li>
<li>install the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmswtpm2/">Software TPM</a>, run <code>make</code> in the <code>src</code>
directory. It will build the <code>tpm_server</code> executable.</li>
<li>install Parsec with the <code>tpm-provider</code> feature: <code>cargo build --features tpm-provider</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the required software is installed you can:</p>
<p>Launch the TPM server in the background (in the <code>src</code> folder where the TPM is installed):</p>
<pre><code>$ rm NVChip # this deletes the TPM cache
$ ./tpm_server &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>Use the TPM tools to startup the TPM server and set its owner hierarchy password (the tools need to
be on the <code>PATH</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ tpm2_startup -c -T mssim
$ tpm2_changeauth -c owner tpm_pass -T mssim
</code></pre>
<p>Start Parsec with the TPM configuration:</p>
<pre><code>$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/parsec -c e2e_tests/provider_cfg/tpm/config.toml
</code></pre>
<p>Which should print a <code>[INFO parsec] Parsec is ready.</code> You can now execute the end-to-end tests using
that provider!</p>

<p>If you do not have a hardware HSM, or you do not want to use it for tests, you might want to use the
Software HSM. You will need to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2">SoftHSMv2</a>. We use version 2.5.0 for tests in
Parsec.</li>
<li>install Parsec with the <code>pkcs11-provider</code> feature: <code>cargo build --features pkcs11-provider</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new token in a new slot.</p>
<pre><code>softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label &quot;Parsec Tests&quot; --pin 123456 --so-pin 123456
</code></pre>
<p>The slot number assigned will be random and can be found and appended at the end of the
configuration file with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>SLOT_NUMBER=`softhsm2-util --show-slots | head -n2 | tail -n1 | cut -d &quot; &quot; -f 2`
# Find all TOML files in the directory (except Cargo.toml) and replace the commented slot number with the valid one
find . -name &quot;*toml&quot; -not -name &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; -exec sed -i &quot;s/^# slot_number.*$/slot_number = $SLOT_NUMBER/&quot; {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>Start Parsec with the PKCS11 configuration:</p>
<pre><code>$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/parsec -c e2e_tests/provider_cfg/pkcs11/config.toml

<p>It is possible to test the Crypto Trusted Service integration through the <code>libts</code> for <code>linux-pc</code>
<a href="https://trusted-services.readthedocs.io/en/integration/deployments/index.html">deployment</a>
available in the project source code. You can find instructions for building and installing the
library
<a href="https://trusted-services.readthedocs.io/en/integration/developer/build-instructions.html">here</a>.
Once the library is installed, no other steps are needed - the whole stack will be housed within the
Parsec service process, similarly to the Mbed Crypto provider.</p>
<p>Start Parsec with the Trusted Service configuration:</p>
<pre><code>$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/parsec -c e2e_tests/provider_cfg/trusted-service/config.toml
</code></pre>
<p>Which should print a <code>[INFO parsec] Parsec is ready.</code> You can now execute the end-to-end tests using
that provider!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The in-process stack uses Mbed Crypto for the crypto implementation, and therefore the
code will be shared with the backend of the Mbed Crypto provider if both are used. Because Mbed
Crypto stores keys on disk, by default in the working directory of the process, creating keys in
both providers in parallel will lead to errors, as one will confuse the keys of the other for its
own.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compilation-tests"><a class="header" href="#cross-compilation-tests">Cross-compilation tests</a></h2>
<p>Given that Parsec is expected to run natively on as many platforms as possible, we have incorporated
cross-compilation testing in our CI framework. These check that the service can be built for the
following platform triples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arm-linux-gnueabihf</code></li>
<li><code>aarch64-linux-gnu</code></li>
<li><code>i686-linux-gnu</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-compilation is tested for the PKCS11, Mbed Crypto, and TPM providers. The Trusted Service
provider is included for cross-compilation to aarch64. You can see details of this test
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/main/test/cross-compile.sh">here</a>. All other CI jobs
run in <code>x86_64-linux-gnu</code>.</p>
<h2 id="in-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#in-dependencies">In dependencies</a></h2>
<p>The dependencies that we maintain in the <code>parallaxsecond</code> organization also contain their own set of
integration and unit tests: <code>parsec-interface-rs</code>, <code>rust-psa-crypto</code>, <code>rust-tss-esapi</code>, and

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="parsec-stability"><a class="header" href="#parsec-stability">Parsec Stability</a></h1>
<p>The work for setting up a stability framework for Parsec was done for the 0.8.0 release, see the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-book/issues/83">related issue</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-stability-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-stability-important">Why is stability important?</a></h2>
<p>Parsec is a long-running service that will be configured, deployed, upgraded and maintained over a
long period of time. The environment will also have client applications that are calling it, and
persistent state that is collected on storage. Components will be upgraded over time. For Parsec to
be supportable in enterprise system, it must not be brittle against upgrades. If Parsec is upgraded
and restarted, client applications should continue working, and all persistent state from prior
versions should remain valid and usable.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-stability-mean-for-the-parsec-service"><a class="header" href="#what-does-stability-mean-for-the-parsec-service">What does stability mean for the Parsec service?</a></h2>
<p>The following definition of stability is chosen for the Parsec service: <em>whatever two versions A and
B of the Parsec binary, B being newer than A, A and B are stable if A can be removed and replaced by
B without breaking anything</em>.</p>
<p>Note that we are not looking at stability in the reverse direction: B cannot be replaced by A
without breaking anything. The only exception is for the communication channel with clients where
any version of the client library can successfully communicate with any version of the service.</p>
<p>The principle of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> is used to describe the stability of
Parsec versions and when breaking changes are done. If <code>parsec</code> version is at <code>1.2.0</code> then all
future stable version to that will be <code>1.x.y</code>. Note that, although semver is used to describe Parsec
stability, it is a strong goal for Parsec to remain stable at a <code>1.x.y</code> version. This document
introduces the efforts that are made so that a <code>MAJOR</code> version bump should hopefully never happen.</p>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-stable"><a class="header" href="#what-needs-to-be-stable">What needs to be stable?</a></h2>
<p>With the above definition, Parsec stays stable if it keeps the exact same communication channels and
format with its environment. Those are already described in the <a href="parsec_service/../parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.html#dataflow-diagram">dataflow
diagram</a> in the threat
model.</p>
<p>The communication channels that need to be stable are (some of them are not in the diagram):</p>
<ol>
<li>Communication with clients
<ol>
<li>Definition of requests/responses (their format)</li>
<li>Definition of operation contracts (their intended behavior)</li>
<li>Definition of Listeners endpoints (how to contact Parsec)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Communication with authenticators</li>
<li>Communication received from the CLI invocation</li>
<li>Configuration file (including default configuration options)</li>
<li>Persistent data stored internally
<ol>
<li>Key mappings</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>OS signals</li>
<li>systemd communication</li>
<li>Dynamic libraries dependencies</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>Hardware backends</li>
<li>Build toolchain</li>
</ol>
<p>Those will be described as &quot;stability requirement&quot; in the remainder of this document. As new
features are added to the codebase, new stability requirements might appear. Those should be added
to the list above and looked in detail below.</p>
<h2 id="stability-review"><a class="header" href="#stability-review">Stability Review</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at each of the points above and check:</p>

<li>how stability is tested</li>

<h3 id="dynamic-libraries"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-libraries">Dynamic libraries</a></h3>
<p>We use the specific versions of those dynamic libraries and test it on CI:</p>
<ul>
<li>PKCS#11 version 2.40</li>
<li>libclang version 6.0</li>
<li>TSS libraries version 2.3.3</li>
<li>CryptoAuthLib version 3.1.0 (not tested on CI, as there is no software mock available)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mbed Crypto is currently compiled from scratch. When a new LTS version of Mbed TLS ships a PSA
Crypto compliant version of Mbed Crypto, stability guarantees will be made on that version.</p>
<p>The Trusted Service provider is currently built using a pre-release version of the Trusted Services
library. We aim to keep the Parsec service aligned with recent revisions of the TS code, however
since no release has been made, no guarantees can be offered about stability. At the time of
writing, no platform is officially supported for Trusted Services deployments.</p>

Identity Provider, as envisaged in the <a href="parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/../../archive/system_architecture.html#participating-components-and-their-roles">System
Architecture</a> page.</p>
<p>Parsec could also be deployed in different configurations with other types of authentication in
place and thus with other requirements for the host environment. The other configurations that have
been considered by the Parsec team are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>(GNRC) Generic deployment model with Identity Provider</li>

substitute identity provider</li>
<li>(DRCT) Direct authentication with mutually trusted clients - no identity provider</li>

an identity provider for clients but it is also used by the service to verify the identities (the
JWT-SVID tokens)</li>

<p><img src="parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/diagrams/dataflow_diagram.png" alt="Dataflow Diagram" /></p>
<h2 id="assumptions"><a class="header" href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>Basic requirements based on which the service can operate securely. Mitigations can be implemented
to make the system more resilient, but if some of these assumptions are not met, the security stance
of the service cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The hardware modules are physically and functionally secure. Only trusted agents can physically
access the system.</li>
<li>The service is configured and started by a trusted administrator.</li>
<li>The OS can be trusted to enforce access-control over critical resources (configuration file, key
info mappings, communication socket, etc.) and inter-process communication mechanisms. System
calls are also trusted to execute correctly.</li>
<li>Users with privilege rights are trusted to exercise them in a non-malicious way.</li>
<li><em>(GNRC, JWTS)</em> The authentication tokens are stored with confidentiality by the clients.</li>
<li><em>(GNRC)</em> There is a trusted Identity Provider available.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<p>What we want to protect. Each one of these has a combination of security properties:
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. The assets are labelled so that it can be seen in the
threat tables below which ones are impacted by each threat.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-token---as1"><a class="header" href="#authentication-token---as1">Authentication Token - AS1</a></h3>
<p>The Client Library gets its Authentication Token from the Identity Provider. It is signed by the
IP's private key and sent by the Client Library on each request. Parsec verifies the Authentication
Token using the IP's public key.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : if known (the authentication token), an attacker could impersonate a specific
application and execute operations in their name. The admin application authentication token is
especially sensitive as if it is stolen by an attacker, they can then have access to operations
impacting all clients such as <code>DeleteClient</code>.</p>
<p><em>(JWTS)</em>: the JWT-SVID tokens share the same Confidentiality property although the verification
happens remotely in the SPIFFE implementation.</p>
<p><em>Not applicable for deployment (DSPC). The OS is trusted to enforce separation between users and to
provide correct peer credential information that the service will then rely upon for access
control.</em></p>
<p><em>Not applicable for deployment (DRCT). Clients are assumed to be mutually trusted and given that we
trust the OS to enforce access control on the service endpoint, there's no concern around the
confidentiality of client identity tokens.</em></p>
<h3 id="identity-provider-public-key--as2"><a class="header" href="#identity-provider-public-key--as2">Identity Provider Public Key- AS2</a></h3>
<p>The IP's public certificate is sent to the service periodically. It is used by the service to verify
the authentication tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : if sent by a malicious IP, attackers could then sign their own application
identities and Parsec will verify them successfully. If they know the Authentication Token of
clients, they can impersonate them.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : Parsec needs it in order to execute a request.</p>
<p><em>Not applicable for deployments (DSPC, DRCT, JWTS).</em></p>
<h3 id="private-keys--as3"><a class="header" href="#private-keys--as3">Private Keys- AS3</a></h3>
<p>Private keys created by Parsec on behalf of its clients. They should be stored on hardware and never
be extractable.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability</strong> : by nature.</p>
<h3 id="clients-data--as4"><a class="header" href="#clients-data--as4">Client's data- AS4</a></h3>
<p>Data sent by the client as part of a request or data about a client processed by the service. This
could appear in logs.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : some of the client's data could be confidential (example: a buffer to
encrypt).</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : the data should not be modifiable by attackers. Parsec should be sure that the
source is trusted, and that the client is not being impersonated.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the client should be able to access its stored data in a certain amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-data--as5"><a class="header" href="#configuration-data--as5">Configuration data- AS5</a></h3>
<p>Data stored in the configuration file, read at each reloading of Parsec to instantiate components.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : the data contains secrets like the user pin of the PKCS 11 device or the owner
hierarchy password of the TPM device.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : the data should only be modified by a trusted Parsec administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the data should be available when loading or re-loading Parsec.</p>
<h3 id="availability-of-the-service--as6"><a class="header" href="#availability-of-the-service--as6">Availability of the service- AS6</a></h3>
<p>General asset to describe the fact that each client's request should be done in a sane amount of
time. The service should be available at any given point from the moment it is started by the
administrator.</p>
<h3 id="key-identity-mappings--as7"><a class="header" href="#key-identity-mappings--as7">Key Identity Mappings- AS7</a></h3>
<p>Data containing the mapping between a Key Identity (application identity, provider identity, key
name) and the key attributes with a provider-specific identifier of the key. For the Mbed Crypto and
PKCS11 providers this is an ID number, for the TPM provider this is the wrapped key.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : Parsec expects this data to be valid.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the data should be available when Parsec needs the specific key.</p>
<h3 id="logs--as8"><a class="header" href="#logs--as8">Logs- AS8</a></h3>
<p>Data stored in logs emitted by any component of the stack.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : the logs can contain confidential information of different parts of the
service.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : the integrity of the logs is essential to prove that some events took place in
Parsec.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the logs should be available for reading and writing when needed.</p>
<h2 id="attackers"><a class="header" href="#attackers">Attackers</a></h2>
<p>Each dataflow is analysed from an attacker's perspective using STRIDE method. Nothing is supposed on
the different components.</p>
<p>In the following tables are present the type of each possible threat, its description, its
mitigation status and the assets impacted. A threat can be unmitigated (U), mitigated within the

<p>The following recommendations should be applied in order for Parsec to respect some of the
operational mitigations. These recommendations have been thought of for a Linux system and should be
modified/ported for other operating systems. The Domain Socket Listener and the On-Disk Key Info
manager are assumed to be used.</p>
<p>The linked <a href="parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.html#operational-mitigations">operational mitigations</a>
are noted with <code>O-n</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The service must be running as the <code>parsec</code> user (O-0).</li>
<li>Key mappings must be located at <code>/var/lib/parsec/mappings</code> and must only be read/write by the
<code>parsec</code> user (O-3).</li>
<li>The logs must be redirected to a file only readable by the <code>parsec</code> user (O-5).</li>
<li>The configuration file must be located at <code>/etc/parsec/config.toml</code> and must only be read/write by
the <code>parsec</code> user (O-6).</li>
<li>The socket folder must be located at <code>/run/parsec/</code> (O-2) and must only be writable by the
<code>parsec</code> user (O-9).</li>
<li>In a deployment using <strong>Direct authentication with mutually trusted clients</strong>, the socket folder
must be group owned by the <code>parsec-clients</code> group which has only read and execute permission on
it (O-10). Everyone else must have no permission on the folder. The <code>parsec-clients</code> group is
composed of mutually trusted clients only. This group must be continuously maintained to contain
the mutually trusted clients.</li>
<li>In a deployment using <strong>Unix Peer Credentials authentication</strong>, everyone else can have read and
execute permission on the socket folder.</li>
<li>In a deployment using <strong>Unix Peer Credentials authentication</strong>, when a Unix account is deleted,
all of its Parsec keys must also be deleted (O-11). This can be done using a <a href="parsec_security/../parsec_users.html">Parsec Client
library</a> or the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-tool"><code>parsec-tool</code></a>. <strong>Warning:</strong> delete keys with
caution and with the knowledge that they will never be needed again, as after this you will not
be able to use them ever again.</li>
<li>In a deployment using <strong>JWT-SVID authentication</strong>, the the Workload API Endpoint location must
exist before the Parsec service is started and originate from a genuine SPIFFE implementation. It
must exist as long as the Parsec service is running using this location.</li>
<li>The Parsec configuration must not be reloaded with a different authenticator if Parsec is
currently storing keys (O-12). To use a different authenticator the <code>mappings</code> folder should
point to a new, unused, location. Alternatively, all keys should be deleted.</li>

<p>This document presents the Threat Model for the Parsec Rust client crate. The interactions between
the Parsec client library and any external software components is assessed. Currently the presence
of an Identity Provider is not considered as part of the scheme due to uncertainty as to how the
dataflow would look in such a case and what security issues might arise. The threat model indirectly
covers a secondary use pattern, namely via a Secure Element Driver (SE Driver) that bridges between
Mbed Crypto and the Parsec client, allowing usage of the Rust stack from a C-language environment.</p>
<h2 id="dataflow-diagram-1"><a class="header" href="#dataflow-diagram-1">Dataflow Diagram</a></h2>
<p><img src="parsec_security/rust_client_threat_model/diagrams/rust_client_diagram.png" alt="Dataflow Diagram" /></p>
<h2 id="assumptions-1"><a class="header" href="#assumptions-1">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>Basic requirements based on which the client can be used securely. Mitigations can be implemented to
make the system more resilient, but if some of these assumptions are not met, the security implied
by Parsec cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The platform on which the client application is running is trusted by the client to host the
Parsec service</li>
<li>With the lack of an identity provider, all applications running in parallel on the platform that
could access the Parsec service are trusted to not interfere with or impersonate the client
application.</li>
<li>The client application obtains or generates a persistent name that it uses consistently for
accessing its service-side assets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assets-1"><a class="header" href="#assets-1">Assets</a></h2>
<p>What we want to protect. Each one of these has a combination of Security Property: Confidentiality,
Integrity and Availability. The assets are labelled so that it can be seen in the threat tables
below which ones are impacted by each threat.</p>
<h3 id="application-identity---as1"><a class="header" href="#application-identity---as1">Application Identity - AS1</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, the Client Library gets its Application Identity from the Identity Provider. However,
without an Identity Provider in the system applications are expected to handle their identities on
their own. The identity will be used by the service to partition the assets it stores for clients
into a namespace for each one.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : if known (the authentication token), an attacker could impersonate a specific
application and execute operations in their name.</p>
<h3 id="clients-data--as2"><a class="header" href="#clients-data--as2">Client’s data- AS2</a></h3>
<p>Data sent through the client as part of a request to the service.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : some of the client’s data could be confidential (example: a buffer to
encrypt).</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : the data should not be modifiable by attackers. The client should be certain that it
is interacting with the legitimate Parsec service.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-data--as3"><a class="header" href="#configuration-data--as3">Configuration data- AS3</a></h3>
<p>Configuration data passed by the client application to the library. There is some overlap between
the configuration data and the application identity, as the identity is stored within the client
library and could thus be considered part of its configuration data.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : if known (the authentication token), an attacker could impersonate a specific
application and execute operations in their name.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : the data should only be modified by the client application as doing otherwise might
prevent the client application from accessing Parsec functionality.</p>
<h3 id="clients-cryptographic-keys---as4"><a class="header" href="#clients-cryptographic-keys---as4">Client’s cryptographic keys - AS4</a></h3>
<p>Keys provisioned by the client within the service.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> : (private) key material is sensitive data and should not be exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> : neither public nor private key data should be modifiable by attackers.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the client must always be able to use their cryptographic material.</p>
<h3 id="system-and-client-application-stability---as5"><a class="header" href="#system-and-client-application-stability---as5">System and client application stability - AS5</a></h3>
<p>The application which is using the Parsec client library and the sytem as a whole must be kept
stable and responsive.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> : the client application must not be crashed by the library in any way.</p>
<h2 id="attackers-1"><a class="header" href="#attackers-1">Attackers</a></h2>
<p>Each dataflow is analysed from an attacker’s perspective using STRIDE method. Nothing is supposed
on the different components.</p>
<p>In the following tables are present the type of each possible threat, its description, its
mitigation status and the assets impacted. A threat can be unmitigated (U), mitigated (M) or

<h2 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>Pull requests introducing new features create new ways in which the service interacts with its
environment. All such new avenues must be thoroughly tested to check both for potential flaws in the
current implementation, and possible regressions due to future iterations or changes.</p>
<p>A list of current types of tests can be found
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/tests/existing_tests.html">here</a>. The
list only looks at the high-level types of tests that we support, but should be a good guide to what
types of tests must be enabled or written. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a <strong>new provider</strong> is introduced, or when <strong>support for some existing operations is added to
an existing provider</strong>, make sure all the end-to-end tests that cover the new functionality are
enabled. This is generally done by means of Cargo features in the <code>e2e-tests</code> crate. If the
provider doesn't support the functionality needed for some test, make sure it is disabled using
such features, e.g. if only EC keys are supported for asymmetric signatures, tests based on RSA
keys should be explicitly disabled (i.e. <code>#[cfg(not(feature = &quot;some-provider&quot;))]</code>), as we
currently have no mechanism for runtime detection of supported parameters. If the provider
includes functionality which does not have proper testing (e.g. a specific key type, an elliptic
curve, etc.), tests must be added. Ideally, when creating a new test for cryptographic
operations, it should be enabled on the Mbed Crypto provider by default. This allows us to make
sure the interface we expose is consistent across all providers. Lots of care <strong>must</strong> also be
taken when first implementing or when modifying the interaction model with key info managers, to
ensure stability in the long run. As such, please ensure that the provider is set up in key
mappings tests which take care of stability of data flows between providers and data stores.</li>
<li>When a <strong>new authenticator</strong> is introduced, make sure tests that mimic the full environment for a
number of clients are introduced. The tests should verify that clients are properly separated
(they cannot access each other's objects), that clients without permissions (if that concept
exists for the authenticator) cannot access the parts of the service which require
authentication, and that admins are recognized properly. Some of these checks can be implemented
as unit tests.</li>
<li>When a <strong>new operation</strong> is introduced into the service, testing must ensure not only that the
operation works and is supported consistently across providers, but also that it fails as
expected for a wide range of potential problems. This testing can be carried out as unit tests
across the stack and end-to-end tests in the service.</li>
<li>When <strong>new configuration features</strong> are added to the service that have a significant effect on how
the service behaves, config tests should be addded to confirm the functionality works, and to
catch future regressions.</li>
<li>When a <strong>new key info manager</strong> is implemented, a new testing framework to ensure long-term
stability of the mappings must be set up. The existing framework(s) for key mapping tests should
provide a good reference.</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="adding-operations-to-parsec"><a class="header" href="#adding-operations-to-parsec">Adding operations to Parsec</a></h1>
<p>This mini how-to will cover how to add operations to the Parsec service and Rust client. The steps
for adding a new provider operation will differ between providers, this guide will cover Mbed
Crypto. The steps for adding operations to <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec">Parsec</a>, <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec-interface-rs">Rust
interface</a>, and <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec-client-rust">Rust client</a> should be the same for all
backend providers.</p>
<h2 id="operation-specification"><a class="header" href="#operation-specification">Operation specification</a></h2>
<h3 id="parsec-book"><a class="header" href="#parsec-book">parsec-book</a></h3>
<p>Create the specification page for the Parsec Book, under
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations/index.html">Operations</a> (can
also be found in the menu on the left of all pages). Include operation details such as parameters,
results, errors specific to the operation, a description, and a link to the
<a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec-operations">protobuf</a> contract (which will be created further on). Also update all API
tables on the <a href="contributing/../parsec_client/operations/service_api_coverage.html">Parsec Operations Coverage</a> page
to reflect the new addition (create any API tables if they are missing).</p>
<p>The opcode used should be the next available one. To find this, go to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/master/src/requests/mod.rs"><code>parsec-interface-rs/src/requests/mod.rs</code></a>
and find the largest in-use opcode.</p>
<h3 id="parsec-operations"><a class="header" href="#parsec-operations">parsec-operations</a></h3>
<p>Create the <code>protobuf</code> contracts in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-operations/tree/master/protobuf"><code>parsec-operations</code></a>.
These are the contracts that client libraries use to communicate with the Parsec service.</p>
<h2 id="rust-interface"><a class="header" href="#rust-interface">Rust Interface</a></h2>
<h3 id="parsec-interface-rs"><a class="header" href="#parsec-interface-rs">parsec-interface-rs</a></h3>
<p>Create the Rust interfaces for the operation. These interfaces go between
<a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec-operations"><code>protobuf</code></a> and the <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec">Parsec service</a> on the service side, and the Rust
client library and protobuf on the client side. Take care when deciding on datatypes. Sensitive data
should be wrapped in either
<a href="https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/struct.Zeroizing.html"><code>Zeroizing</code></a> or
<a href="https://docs.rs/secrecy/latest/secrecy/struct.Secret.html"><code>Secret</code></a> (choose depending on the
sensitivity of the data. Favor
<a href="https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/struct.Zeroizing.html"><code>Zeroizing</code></a> unless there is a clear
requirement for <a href="https://docs.rs/secrecy/latest/secrecy/struct.Secret.html"><code>Secret</code></a>) to ensure
they are wiped from memory when dropped and should not have any output for debugging. The operation
definitions are stored in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/tree/master/src/operations"><code>src/operations/</code></a>.</p>
<p>A <code>validate</code> method can be added to allow easy validation of the properties of the operations, to
check if there are any conflicting options, or combinations of options that are invalid. Tests must
be added for each operation with a validate method, to check it catches all erroneous combinations
of operation, and passes valid combinations.</p>
<p>A converter then needs to be added to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/tree/master/src/operations_protobuf"><code>src/operations_protobuf</code></a>.
This will convert to and from the protobuf contract and the Rust interface. There should be four
methods per operation; two for going to and from the operation struct, and two for going to and from
the result struct. Again, tests need to be added to ensure all conversions happen correctly.</p>
<p>New protobuf operations need to be added to the <code>parsec-operations</code> submodule - do this by entering
the submodule, then fetching and checking out the new contracts. Protobuf-generated code needs to be
committed in the repository to speed up the builds and remove some of the dependencies. You
therefore need to run a build using the <code>regenerate-protobuf</code> feature enabled and then to identify
the generated Rust file in the correct directory, e.g.
<code>target/debug/build/parsec-interface-fdbf7d7248ab4615/out/</code>. The file must be copied to
<code>src/operations_protobuf/generated_ops/</code> and enabled as a module in <code>mod.rs</code>. If your Rust operation
and/or result interfaces do not contain any sensitive information, add them to the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/f924c0f45695ebd88e34537934c579be8909cced/src/operations_protobuf/generated_ops.rs#L129"><code>empty_clear_message!</code></a>
block. Otherwise, implement
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/f924c0f45695ebd88e34537934c579be8909cced/src/operations_protobuf/generated_ops.rs#L116"><code>ClearProtoMessage</code></a>

<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/f924c0f45695ebd88e34537934c579be8909cced/src/operations_protobuf/generated_ops.rs#L146"><code>zeroize</code></a>
any of the sensitive fields.</p>
<p>In
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/master/src/requests/mod.rs"><code>src/requests/mod.rs</code></a>,
add the opcode that was specified in the <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#parsec-book"><code>parsec-book</code></a> for the operation. Finally,
add the relevant
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/f924c0f45695ebd88e34537934c579be8909cced/src/operations/mod.rs#L32"><code>NativeOperation</code></a>

to the Opcode. Then, add <code>From</code> implementations to <code>NativeOperation</code> and <code>NativeResult</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, add the <code>mod</code> declaration in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs/blob/master/src/operations_protobuf/mod.rs"><code>src/operations_protobuf/mod.rs</code></a>,

<p>Locate the parts of the <a href="https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/index.html">PSA API</a> in Mbed
Crypto that will need to be used during the operation you are adding. This includes all constants,
datatypes, macros and functions. Note: Mbed Crypto does not yet fully conform to the PSA API 1.0
specification, so there may be inconsistencies between the PSA documentation and the macros and
functions that Mbed Crypto exposes.</p>
<p>Starting in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/tree/master/psa-crypto-sys"><code>psa-crypto-sys</code></a>,
constants are added to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/constants.rs"><code>constants.rs</code></a>.
Inline functions and macros require a shim. Add the inline function and macro definitions into
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/c/shim.h"><code>shim.h</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/c/shim.c"><code>shim.c</code></a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/shim.rs"><code>shim.rs</code></a>.
When adding entries to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/shim.rs"><code>shim.rs</code></a>,
take note of where you place
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code"><code>unsafe</code></a>.
If the <a href="https://armmbed.github.io/mbed-crypto/html/index.html">PSA API</a> specification states that
under any circumstance, an unspecified result can be returned, then mark the entire <code>fn</code> definition
as <code>unsafe</code>. Otherwise, if the return values are always specified, wrap the call to the shim method
as <code>unsafe</code>. Regular functions are added to <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/blob/master/psa-crypto-sys/src/lib.rs"><code>pub use psa_crypto_binding::{ … }</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="psa-crypto"><a class="header" href="#psa-crypto">psa-crypto</a></h3>
<p>Define a Rust native interface for the operation you are adding in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/tree/master/psa-crypto/src/operations"><code>src/operations</code></a>,
along with any Rust native types you need in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/tree/master/psa-crypto/src/types"><code>src/types</code></a>.
Generally, any helper macro functions are placed in the <code>impl</code> block of the Rust native type they
are for.</p>
<p>The interface will work between the Rust native datatypes given to it and the C bindings in
<a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#psa-crypto-sys"><code>psa-crypto-sys</code></a>. It is important to ensure that the Rust interface handles all
possible situations (e.g. closing a key-handle on an error) to ensure it is a safe Rust native
interface to the operation.</p>
<p>At this point, you will now have a safe Rust interface for the PSA operation you added.</p>
<h3 id="parsec-1"><a class="header" href="#parsec-1">parsec</a></h3>
<p>Add the new operation to the correct
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/tree/master/src/providers">provider</a> (in this case, <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/tree/master/src/providers/mbed_crypto">Mbed
Crypto</a>) as a
<code>psa_xxx_internal</code> method. The operation method should take the user inputs, arrange them in a way
that <a href="contributing/adding_new_operation_how_to.html#psa-crypto"><code>psa-crypto</code></a> accepts, and provide any extra logic or storage if required (e.g.
an output buffer). The external implementation is to be added to the provider’s
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/src/providers/mbed_crypto/mod.rs"><code>mod.rs</code></a>
file, which outputs a trace entry and passes the call back to the internal implementation.</p>
<p>A default implementation is added to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/src/providers/mod.rs"><code>src/providers/mod.rs</code></a>
that is used when a provider does not support a particular operation. It outputs a trace entry and
returns an error, stating that the operation is not supported. The external implementation in the
provider’s <code>mod.rs</code> overrides this.</p>
<p>Add the <code>NativeOperation</code> mapping in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/src/back/backend_handler.rs"><code>src/back/backend_handler.rs</code></a>
<code>execute_request</code> function so Parsec can call the correct operation method when it receives a
request.</p>
<p>Finally, add <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/tree/master/e2e_tests/tests/per_provider">end to end (e2e)
testing</a> for the
new operation. Operations are added to
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/e2e_tests/src/lib.rs"><code>e2e_tests/src/lib.rs</code></a>
to save from code duplication in the tests. This also makes it quick and easy to write tests, and to
see exactly what operations a test is performing. Test should be very thorough, taking the operation
through valid and invalid inputs, checking that the proper output is returned. If possible, external
data and crates should be used during testing. E.g. if testing the cryptographic operation, generate
keys and an encrypted message externally and test that Parsec can correctly decrypt the message.
(Note: if crates are added solely for testing purposes, add them to <code>[dev-dependencies]</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/e2e_tests/Cargo.toml"><code>Cargo.toml</code></a>)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="package-management-and-versioning-guide"><a class="header" href="#package-management-and-versioning-guide">Package management and versioning guide</a></h1>
<p>This page presents the details around packaging management and versioning for Parsec-related
repositories. Currently our repos are mainly Rust crates, so this guide is accordingly geared
towards them - when other guidelines become relevant, e.g. specific to Go libraries, new sections
should be added below.</p>
<p>The following points are relevant to all software we publish to package management repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>For published versions of a project a tag carrying the version number should be upstreamed to
GitHub, e.g. if version 2.3.1 was published, a tag named &quot;2.3.1&quot; must be added to the commit in
GitHub.</li>
<li>If multiple projects that end up in a package manager reside in the same repo, the tags should
reflect both the project and the version number, e.g. if version 2.3.1 of project X was
published, a tag named &quot;X-2.3.1&quot; or similar must be used.</li>
<li>Projects should follow <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> rules.</li>
<li>Following the release of a new version of publicly-facing projects, update the <code>CHANGELOG.md</code>
file. For some projects it's also advised to create a GitHub Release from the tag mentioned
above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-crates"><a class="header" href="#rust-crates">Rust crates</a></h2>
<p>The process around publishing Rust crates is tightly linked with crates.io. In order to publish or
have control over crates, you must own an account on the website. Before you decide whether you want
to publish a crate, check out the <a href="contributing/package_management.html#dependency-management">Dependency management</a> section below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html">here</a> to
create your account and to set your workspace up.</li>
<li>If you'd like to publish a new version of an existing crate using the ownership granted to the
Parallaxsecond Admin group, you need to enable crates.io to access that organization. You can do
so from the <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">applications page</a> in your account
settings - in the <a href="https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/9fe8110dfe185fe90b5c">crates.io
application</a> settings
you must request permission for the parallaxsecond org to be linked. One of the org owners must
approve that request.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you'd like to publish a new version but are not part of the Admin group, you can
request to become an owner of the crate from one of the admins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are able to publish crates you can start doing so, but being aware of the following facts
is helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have settled on a crate to upstream, make sure you are on the most recent version of the
main branch (e.g. <code>master</code>) - you should have no uncommited changes lingering.</li>
<li>Run a <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> to make sure that any submodules are up to date
and checked out locally, as they will be included in the crate.</li>
<li>Run a <code>cargo publish --dry-run</code> - this ensures that the publishing process is possible with the
current state of the repo.</li>
<li>Change the version number of the crate in <code>Cargo.toml</code> following semantic versioning rules.</li>
<li>If any other (small) changes must be made, such as updating a dependency, you can also add them in
this commit. No specific limit is given to &quot;small&quot;, but if the dependency update includes changes
to an API or to how some internal components work, then a separate pull request is needed.</li>
<li>Commit the previous changes and either upstream them directly to the main branch or create a pull
request.</li>
<li>Once the version change is on the main branch, run another dry-run publishing, followed by the
real operation. Once that is complete, tag the latest commit and upstream the tag.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for every crate along the way in the dependency tree.</li>
<li>If the crate you are publishing is new or has major changes in its build steps, its documentation
might not be built properly by docs.rs. This is because docs.rs has its own build system where
crates are built in complete isolation from the internet and with a set of dependencies that
might not cover the ones you require. Check out their documentation
<a href="https://docs.rs/about/builds">here</a>. If you want to be extra-careful and sure that your
documentation will build successfully, you can set up a local <code>docs.rs</code> and attempt to build your
crate. You can find the instructions
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs#getting-started">here</a>. Follow them up to setting up the
external services, then run the command for building a local crate from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs#build-subcommand">here</a>. Be advised that setting up the
docs.rs build locally requires 10 GiB of disk space (or more) and is quite slow the first time
around, but caching helps with subsequent builds. It is therefore not recommended for CI runs,
though manually triggered builds might be ok. Also be advised that even if the build fails, the
command itself will <strong>not</strong> fail - instead, you have to either visually check that the crate was
built successfully, or to look for a string marking a successful build, e.g. <code>cargo run -- build crate tss-esapi-sys 0.1.1 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null | grep &quot;[INFO] rustwide::cmd: [stderr] Finished dev&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dependency-management"><a class="header" href="#dependency-management">Dependency management</a></h3>
<p>Producing a release of the Parsec service requires some understanding of the way in which all the
components, and especially the various crates found under the Parallaxsecond organization, relate to
each other. You can find some details of the code structure
<a href="contributing/../parsec_service/source_code_structure.html">here</a>. A detailed list of direct dependencies to
Parallaxsecond crates that can be found on crates.io is given below.</p>
<p><code>parsec-service</code> dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parsec-interface</code>: used for managing IPC communication</li>
<li><code>psa-crypto</code>: used in the Mbed Crypto provider as the interface to a PSA Crypto implementation,
and in the Cryptoki crate for conversions between the two standards</li>
<li><code>cryptoki</code>: used in the PKCS11 provider as the interface to PKCS11 libraries</li>
<li><code>tss-esapi</code>: used in the TPM provider as the interface to the TSS stack</li>
<li><code>parsec-client</code>: <strong>NOT</strong> used in the service, but as a dependency for the test client</li>
</ul>
<p><code>parsec-interface</code> dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>psa-crypto</code>: used to represent the Rust-native PSA Crypto data types</li>
</ul>
<p><code>parsec-client</code> dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parsec-interface</code>: used for managing IPC communication</li>
</ul>
<p><code>parsec-tool</code> dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parsec-client</code>: used to handle all communication with the service</li>
</ul>
<p>Publishing new versions of dependencies is not always required. If you're not planning to
immediately publish some crate, then you don't <em>need</em> to publish any of its dependencies, you can
simply import updates, using the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories"><code>git</code></a>
syntax, as transient dependencies in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. By doing so, however, you're removing the option
of publishing to crates.io until all those <code>git</code> dependencies are removed. Because of this issue we
suggest adding transient dependencies to crates not residing under the Parallaxsecond organization
only when a published version of the third party crate is due soon. This is to limit the likelihood
of an urgent release of Parsec being stalled behind a third-party release cycle. If you're unsure
about or would want to discuss such an approach, we welcome discussions and proposals in our
community channels!</p>
<h3 id="docker-images"><a class="header" href="#docker-images">Docker images</a></h3>
<p>End-to-end testing for the Parsec service (and for some of the other projects under the
Parallaxsecond organization) is built on top of Docker images. These images are required because of
the multitude of dependencies needed, generally for connecting to various backends through 3rd party
libraries. The Docker images separate the process of setting up this environment from the actual
running of tests, allowing very short CI runs.</p>
<p>Our Docker images are stored as <a href="https://github.com/orgs/parallaxsecond/packages">packages</a> within
the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/container-guides-for-github-packages">Github Container
Registry</a>. The ones
used for the service have <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/tree/main/e2e_tests/docker_image">their own
folder</a>.</p>
<p>The process for updating an existing image (or indeed creating a new one) goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out if what you need should be included in a Docker image. Anything that is sure to be
common between builds should be included: compilers, toolchains, libraries...</li>
<li>Modify or create a new Docker image. This involves not just the development side, but also
building the image and testing locally that your expected flow works correctly.</li>
<li>Modify any CI-related files to set up workflows to build the image and to perform any new actions
with it (if necessary). You should also include changes to the rest of the code-base that
produced the need for the image change.</li>
<li>Create a PR with your changes. This allows other reviewers to provide feedback on the image
definition before it is published. Once the changes are approved you can continue to the next
step.</li>
<li>Build the image with the correct tag: for images stored in Github Container Registry, the tag
should be <code>ghcr.io/parallaxsecond/&lt;your-image-name&gt;:latest</code>.</li>
<li>Create a Github Personal Access Token for publishing the image, as described
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/pushing-and-pulling-docker-images">here</a>. Follow the
steps on the page to then publish your image.</li>
<li>If this is a new image being published, after the upload succeeds, follow the steps
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-access-control-and-visibility-for-container-images#configuring-access-to-container-images-for-an-organization">here</a>
to allow the <code>parallaxsecond/admin</code> group admin access to the image. If you are using the image
in CI builds, you will also need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-access-control-and-visibility-for-container-images#configuring-visibility-of-container-images-for-an-organization">make it
public</a>.</li>
<li>Change the workflows to use the published image and update the PR.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-parsec-release-process"><a class="header" href="#the-parsec-release-process">The Parsec Release Process</a></h1>
<p>This page describes the process by which the Parsec project is released, and sets expectations
around the schedule of releases so that consumers know when to expect them.</p>
<h2 id="release-schedule"><a class="header" href="#release-schedule">Release Schedule</a></h2>
<p>The Parsec project aims to make major releases twice a year: in early March and early September.
Precise dates are agreed by the maintainers and the project community on each cycle. A fixed release
cadence helps with the process of packaging Parsec releases into Operating System distributions and
other downstream consumers.</p>
<p>This page focuses on the process for twice-yearly major releases. Naturally, it is expected that
minor point releases will also take place to address defects or to add other improvements that are
needed urgently and cannot wait for the next major cycle. A fixed process for such point releases
has not yet been established, but this will be determined according to which practices appear to
work well within the project community.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility-for-releases"><a class="header" href="#responsibility-for-releases">Responsibility for Releases</a></h2>
<p>It is the collective responsibility of the <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.toml">Parsec project
maintainers</a> to ensure that
Parsec releases are made according to the schedule and process outlined on this page. However, all
project contributors have a role to play in ensuring that the release cycles are timely and
successful. All contributors are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the release process, and
all are expected to abide by its associated rules.</p>
<h2 id="release-roadmap"><a class="header" href="#release-roadmap">Release Roadmap</a></h2>
<p>A public roadmap for the Parsec project is under construction. In the meantime, the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/parallaxsecond/projects/1">Project
dashboard</a> can be used to track the items that
are being prepared for the next release. Use the
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/milestones">milestones</a> to filter the dashboard view in
order to see the issue tickets that have been targeted for each release.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the content of a release cannot be guaranteed. In order to ensure a fixed
release schedule, it is sometimes necessary to modify the scope of each release. The project
dashboard always provides the best available indication of the current plan.</p>
<h2 id="released-components"><a class="header" href="#released-components">Released Components</a></h2>
<p>A Parsec release always includes the following two components, which are released together as a
pair:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec">Parsec service</a>, which is the primary component of
the project, and is the daemon that provides security services to client applications and
interfaces with the secure hardware facilities of the host platform.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-tool">Parsec tool</a>, which is a command-line tool
that allows the functionality of the service to be accessed easily from shell environments and
scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these components are included because they are both built from Rust and share a common set
of dependencies. A coordinated release allows for the versions of the shared Rust crates to be kept
synchronized. These two components are also both commonly packaged for Operating System
distributions.</p>
<p>Additionally, each release includes a convenient
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/getting_started/linux_x86.html">quickstart</a> package,
which contains the binaries for just the Parsec service and the Parsec tool, along with a basic
configuration file and a README document with a link to the quickstart guide. This is to help new
users gain some early familiarity with the system.</p>
<p>Other components of the Parsec project, such as documentation and client libraries in languages
other than Rust, are currently not included in the scheduled release cadence. These components are
instead being released according to their own separate schedules. The release processes and timings
for those components are not described on this page.</p>
<h2 id="release-version-numbering"><a class="header" href="#release-version-numbering">Release Version Numbering</a></h2>
<p>The many components and repositories that make up the Parsec project all have their own version
numbering schemes, which are not necessarily aligned with each other. However, since the primary
component of the Parsec project is the Parsec service, it is the version number of the Parsec
service that is used to denote the version number of each Parsec release.</p>
<p>For example, the Parsec <code>0.7.0</code> release, which was made in March 2021, was so called because the
Parsec service was at version <code>0.7.0</code> for that particular release, even though the Parsec tool was
at <code>0.3.0</code>, and the various other component repositories were tagged according to their own schemes.</p>
<h2 id="common-rust-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#common-rust-dependencies">Common Rust Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>All of the Rust crates that make up a Parsec release will be published at a single common version
number for the release. This is to ensure that the Parsec service and Parsec tool will always be
consuming a single common version of each crate. Having multiple versions of the same crate in a
single release makes it difficult for packaging the release into Operating System distributions, and
so this is avoided.</p>
<p>For example, the Parsec <code>0.7.0</code> release was composed from version <code>0.7.0</code> of the Parsec service, and
<code>0.3.0</code> of the Parsec tool. The
<a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-interface-rs">parsec-interface-rs</a> crate is consumed into
both of these components. Its version was set at <code>0.24.0</code>, and this single common version was
consumed into both the Parsec service and the Parsec tool for the combined <code>0.7.0</code> release. A
similar strategy was adopted for other common Rust crates in the project.</p>
<p>For more information about the Rust crate dependencies, including full details on how to release
them individually, please refer to the <a href="contributing/package_management.html">Package Management and Versioning
Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="release-codenames"><a class="header" href="#release-codenames">Release Codenames</a></h2>
<p>The Parsec project does not employ codenames for releases. Future releases are simply named
according to the expected version number of the Parsec service.</p>
<h2 id="code-freeze-and-release-branching"><a class="header" href="#code-freeze-and-release-branching">Code Freeze and Release Branching</a></h2>
<p>Shortly before each Parsec release, a code freeze will be put into effect, and a release branch will
be cut from main. Precise details around code freezing and branching will be communicated through
the community channels by the maintainers on each release cycle. Branching details may vary, and not
all repositories will necessarily be branched for every release.</p>
<p>Code freeze dates may also vary depending on the content of each release. Typically, a code freeze
will occur at around 2-4 weeks before the target release date.</p>
<p>During the code freeze period, code submissions will only be accepted if they address critical
defects or other issues that are blocking the release.</p>
<p>Shortly after the code freeze date, a release candidate will be published for each of the Parsec
service and Parsec tool. The availability of this release candidate will be communicated to
downstream consumers such as Operating System maintainers, giving them the opportunity to perform
integration testing before the release is finalized.</p>
<h2 id="testing-of-releases"><a class="header" href="#testing-of-releases">Testing of Releases</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the regular CI tests, contributors and integrators are invited to perform their own
targeted testing ahead of each release. For example, if a contributor has developed a feature that
requires testing with a specific hardware platform or configuration, then they would be expected to
perform whatever testing is necessary to verify that the new feature has reached a sufficient
quality level for the release. Systems integrators and known adopters of Parsec will also be
notified that a new release is available for integration testing.</p>
<p>As part of the release testing, we run the end-to-end tests on a RaspberryPi for the following
backends:</p>
<ul>
<li>mbed crypto</li>
<li>TPM</li>
<li>Nitrokey HSM</li>
</ul>
<p>Further platforms and backends will be added to this in future releases. The results of the release
testing are critical in determining if the parsec service and the tool are ready for release, and
whether they meet the requirements and expectations of the end users. Any regressions will result in
the creation of a new GitHub issue and will be flagged to the community for assessment as to whether
it is a blocking issue for the release.</p>
<h2 id="release-expectations"><a class="header" href="#release-expectations">Release Expectations</a></h2>
<p>All releases should follow the <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/contributing/release_checklist.html">Parsec Release
Checklist</a> and
ensure that the new release works on a fixed set of platforms. By complying with the Release
Checklist, the release should not contain any known security vulnerabilities, there should be no
added regression on the release tests and the quality requirements (coding style, best practices,
etc.) of the project should be met. Parsec is a public open source project and it can be used in a
variety of contexts. It is the responsibility of the system integrator or Parsec adopter to ensure
its suitability for use in any product or other context. Any questions around specific expectations
and requirements can be raised with the Parsec maintainers through the available <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/community">community
channels</a>.</p>
<h2 id="feature-branches"><a class="header" href="#feature-branches">Feature Branches</a></h2>
<p>For complex features whose development is likely to go beyond the code freeze date for the next
scheduled release, the use of feature branches may be appropriate, and this can be agreed between
the relevant contributors and project maintainers on a case-by-case basis. It is not always
necessary to use a feature branch. However, if any partially-complete features are merged into the
main branch, this <em>must</em> be done in a way that does not disrupt the release process. To ensure this,
please abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html">Cargo features</a> to allow the changes
to be compiled conditionally, and ensure that any new dependencies are made optional and
conditional on the Cargo features.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories">Git
dependencies</a>
in the main branch of Parsec repositories. Git dependencies are sometimes appropriate and useful
in feature branches, but they should be avoided in main branches where possible. Git dependencies
block the release process, and they must always be replaced with numbered crate versions well
before the next code freeze period.</li>
<li>Ensure that all relevant Continuous Integration tests are passing for code that is promoted to
main branches.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are planning to contribute a significant feature or major architectural change, please
contact the maintainers via the available community channels, such as the Slack channel or the
weekly meetings. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/community">community</a> repository
for more details. The project maintainers will be available to advise you on whether to use a
feature branch.</p>
<p>When using feature branches, please ensure that commits are reviewed by the project maintainers
through the pull request process at suitable intervals, so that reviews can be kept small and
manageable. Do not wait until the entire feature is complete before requesting code reviews, since
large and bulky code reviews are generally not well received by the maintainers, and this might
delay the approval of changes.</p>
<p>To keep the repositories tidy, the maintainers will aim to delete feature branches as soon as
possible after the code changes have been promoted into the mainline. Please contact the maintainers
through the community channels to request the deletion of a feature branch.</p>

<p>This document sets out a system architecture for a deployment of the security service as part of a
complete system where it can be used by client applications. This system architecture is constructed
around an example deployment where the applications are running in containers within a shared
operating system kernel (without full virtualisation). This is not the only possible deployment
pattern, and many of the concepts in this document could be adapted to suit other deployments.</p>
<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The security service provides an API to key storage and cryptographic operations. This API is based
on the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto API
Specification</strong></a>.
The API is exposed to clients over a transport medium using a <a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a>, so that it can be consumed by client applications in
multiple programming languages, residing in separate processes on the shared physical host. The
security service is a <strong>multi-tenant</strong> service. It isolates and partitions the key store such that
secure assets provisioned by one client application cannot be used by another. This isolation can
only be achieved if every client application is able to present a unique and stable identity to the
security service. This identity also has to be validated on the host system, so that client
applications can prove their identity and therefore authenticate themselves to use the security
service.</p>
<p>The distribution and validation of client identitites is a vital part of the overall deployment of
the system. This system architecture sets out one possible way in which this can be achieved
end-to-end.</p>
<p>The goal of this or any system architecture is to show how any client application can call an
individual cryptographic operation, such that the security service can not only trust the source of
the call, but also perform it with the required degree of isolation from other clients.</p>
<p>Isolation is based on the critical concept of an <strong>application identity</strong>. An application identity
is a canonical string value, akin to a namespace, which is used to partition all storage (whether
persistent or ephemeral) and all activities within the security service. Application identities are
unique per client application. They are stable across application restarts, system restarts, and
component upgrades.</p>
<p>The system architecture enables each client application to pass its application identity to the
security service in a way that is cryptographically proven end-to-end. This allows the security
service to trust the caller's identity, and to implement the required isolation. The architecture
achieves this by placing the security service alongside some additional components that understand
the client application lifecycle and are able to both provide and prove the identity string for each
client.</p>
<p>The system architecture document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of <strong>design goals</strong> is established to act as guiding principles and constraints for the
architecture.</li>
<li>The <strong>participating components</strong> are listed along with a definition of their roles within the
system. Note that the security service is the only component whose implementation is contained in
this source code repository. Additional components are implemented separately. This document only
sets out the required roles and contracts of those additional components. Their precise
implementation can depend on the deployment.</li>
<li>The <strong>trust relationships</strong> are described in terms of how they are established and maintained, and
also in terms of which components share such relationships.</li>
<li>The <strong>trusted data payloads</strong> are described. These are the data objects that are subject to
cryptographic signing and verification according to the defined trust relationships.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>flows</strong> of data between components are captured in a sequence diagram, which shows
how the system is bootstrapped and then used on an ongoing basis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-goals"><a class="header" href="#design-goals">Design Goals</a></h2>
<p>The system architecture aims to address the following design goals and constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system should be <strong>fault tolerant</strong> in general, but specifically with respect to any transient
loss or restart of any of the participating components. If one component restarts, then other
components should be able to recover their ability to communicate with it, such that there is no
loss of functionality across the system as a whole. It is acceptable for sub-optimal performance
to be incurred for a transient period during recovery.</li>
<li>Communication channels should be <strong>stateless</strong>. This is partly to address the fault-tolerance
requirement set out above, but also because it is generally considered to be good practice in
service-oriented architectures of which this system is an example. The participating components
will necessarily have their own internal state where needed, both persistent and ephemeral. The
security service, for example, has at least one store for secure assets (such as keys). But
components should not rely on shared state without an ability to re-synchronize that state at
arbitrary times.</li>
<li>Communication channels should be <strong>secretless</strong>. Passing private keys or other secrets across wire
protocol interfaces is forbidden. Only public keys or other non-confidential assets can be
passed.</li>
<li>Components should store any secret data <strong>in local process memory only</strong>, unless there is an
overriding requirement for it to be stored persistently. Trust relationships between components
need to be re-established (by sharing the public part of a new key pair) in the case where a
component is restarted.</li>
<li>The system should be <strong>cryptographically secure</strong>. A cryptographically-provable mechanism must
exist in the communication channels between components.</li>
<li>Cryptographic security should be established on a <strong>short-lived</strong> basis. Trust between components
must be refreshed periodically.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="participating-components-and-their-roles"><a class="header" href="#participating-components-and-their-roles">Participating Components and their Roles</a></h2>
<p>The system architecture defines the following participating components, all of which are assumed to
co-reside on the same physical host:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>client application</strong> is the ultimate consumer of the security API. Any number of client
applications can share the same physical host. They can be written in different programming
languages, and reside across multiple containers or processes. The functionality of each client
application is arbitrary, and the only thing that they have in common is their shared requirement
to access the cryptographic services of the host platform. Client applications should not be
confused with processes or containers. It is possible for a single client application to be
spread across multiple processes or containers. Conversely, it is possible for a single process
or container to house multiple client applications. The boundary between client applications is a
security boundary that is defined and arbitrated by other components in the system.</li>
<li>The <strong>client library</strong> is a convenience layer that provides a simplified and idiomatic way to
access the security API in a specific programming language. The client library is loaded by the
client application and shares its address space. Communications between the client application
and the client library are in-process and in-language procedure calls with no IPC. There is one
client library per supported programming language. Client libraries are more than just bindings.
Each one offers a highly-designed developer experience tailored to the programming language,
providing the API in a form that is simple to consume and hard to get wrong. This means that it
has facilities for things like smart defaulting, so that the client application can call APIs
with fewer arguments and simplified contracts that are tailored for specific use cases. The
client library is then fundamentally an adapter or wrapper: it converts between the simplified
developer experience and the comprehensive API definition based on the PSA Crypto API. It makes
calls to the security service according to the defined <a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol
specification</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>orchestrator</strong> is the component that manages the lifecycle of the client applications on the
physical host. It is responsible for starting and stopping their containers or processes. In a
containerized environment on a Linux system, a daemon such as
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/"><strong>dockerd</strong></a> would naturally
assume the role of the orchestrator in this system architecture. A single instance of the
orchestrator runs on the host system.</li>
<li>The <strong>security service</strong> is the component that provides the API to the cryptographic services of
the host platform. This API is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto API
Specification</strong></a>.
A single instance of this service runs on the host system (deployed, for example, as a daemon).
It listens on a suitable host-local transport medium such as a Unix domain socket and exposes a
<a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol</strong></a> with a <a href="archive/../parsec_client/api_overview.html"><strong>defined
API</strong></a>. The inner architecture of the service is described in
the other documents in this repository.</li>
<li>The <strong>identity provider</strong> is the component that assigns unique and stable application identities
to each client application. Any string that can be used persistently and unambiguously to refer
to one and only one client application is suitable. This system architecture proposes the use of
a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as the identity scheme used by
<a href="https://spiffe.io"><strong>SPIFFE</strong></a>. The identity provider receives application lifecycle events from
the orchestrator, and these events contain enough information for the identity provider to deduce
the application identity and return it to client applications on request. The identity provider
is fundamentally a mapping service, with orchestrator data as its input and application
identities as its output. The identity provider exposes the same <a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a> as the security service, albeit with a different
set of APIs to reflect its very different role.</li>
<li>The <strong>crypto provider</strong> is a back-end software module within the security service that interfaces
with the hardware or software facilities of the platform in order to implement key storage and
cryptographic operations. Within the service itself, these modules are simply called &quot;providers&quot;,
but the term &quot;crypto provider&quot; is used here to avoid confusion with the identity provider
component. Crypto providers provide access to hardware facilities such as Trusted Platform
Modules (TPMs) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Alternatively, they might interact with
software components running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or secure enclave, if the
host platform supports them. Their implementations would vary considerably depending on the
platforms, and these details are largely irrelevant to the system architecture. They are included
here largely for completeness, since they are the ultimate provider of the cryptographic services
being consumed by the client applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trust-relationships"><a class="header" href="#trust-relationships">Trust Relationships</a></h2>
<p>This section outlines the trust relationships that exist between components, how they are
established, and how they are maintained over the component lifetimes. This section covers only
those trust relationships that are material to the system architecture: other trust relationships
might exist in the system for various reasons.</p>
<p>The trust relationships detailed below are always established between pairs of components: the
<strong>trusted component</strong> and the <strong>trusting component</strong>. They are based on <strong>asymmetric digital
signatures</strong>. They rely on trusted component being able to sign some data such that the trusting
component can verify it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The trusted component generates a <strong>root key-pair</strong>.</li>
<li>The trusted component maintains the <strong>root private key</strong> in process-local memory only. The private
key is not shared with any other component, nor is it stored persistently.</li>
<li>The trusted component sends the <strong>root public key</strong> to the trusting component as an X509
certificate. This is done by making an API call according to the conventions of the <a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol specification</strong></a>. This is strictly a one-time
operation, and this must be enforced by the trusting component. Any attempt to send revised root
keys must be rejected. For more information, refer to the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> operation in the
API reference.</li>
<li>On a periodic basis, the trusted component generates a new <strong>intermediate key pair</strong>, and once
again keeps the private key in process-local memory only.</li>
<li>On each periodic refresh, the trusted component sends a new <strong>intermediate public key</strong> to the
trusting component, again as an X509 certificate. (This allows the trusting component to view the
intermediate certificate and the root certificate as a chain).</li>
<li>In general communication, the trusted component will use its private key to sign data, and the
trusting component will use the public certificate chain to verify it. If verification passes,
then the data can be trusted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &quot;root&quot; here should be qualified, since any root key or certificate is only a root from the
perspective of this system architecture. This does not exclude the possibility that these roots are
themselves part of a longer trust chain involving an external Certificate Authority (CA).
Integrations with external CAs are outside of the scope of this document. The term &quot;root&quot; should
always be considered with this qualification in mind.</p>
<p>In this system architecture, two trust relationships exist, each of which is established and
maintained according to the scheme described above. The trust relationships are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the <strong>orchestrator</strong> and the <strong>identity provider</strong>. In this case, the orchestrator is the
trusted component and the identity provider is the trusting component. The need for a trust
relationship here is due to the orchestrator being a presenter of client definitions and proofs
to the identity provider.</li>
<li>Between the <strong>identity provider</strong> and the <strong>security service</strong>. In this case, the identity
provider is the trusted component and the security service is the trusting component. The need
for this trust relationship is to allow the identity provider to sign authentication tokens on
behalf of each client, such that the security service can verify those tokens and permit an API
call to proceed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wire-protocols"><a class="header" href="#wire-protocols">Wire Protocols</a></h2>
<p>Both the identity provider and the security service expose an API endpoint based on the common
<a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a>. However, the roles of these
two components are very different, and it follows that the set of API operations offered by each
endpoint will be likewise different. In the case of the security service, the majority of its API
operations are for key storage and cryptography, and are based on the PSA Crypto API. In the case of
the identity provider, a much smaller set of operations are needed, and these enable the sharing of
client definitions and proofs.</p>
<p>The only part of the API that is common between the two components is the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong>
operation, which is used to establish and maintain trust relationships.</p>
<p>The identity provider additionally offers the <strong>AddClient</strong> and <strong>ProveClient</strong> operations, which
allow the orchestrator to inform the identity provider about the lifecycle of client applications.
This small operation set represents the entirety of the identity provider's API.</p>
<p>By contrast, the security service exposes the full capabilities of the PSA Crypto API.</p>
<h2 id="trusted-data-payloads"><a class="header" href="#trusted-data-payloads">Trusted Data Payloads</a></h2>
<p>A trusted data payload is any data payload that is signed and verified according to one of the
defined trust relationships. Since two trust relationships are defined in this system architecture,
it follows that a trusted data payload is either a payload that is signed by the orchestrator and
verified by the identity provider, or it is a payload that is signed by the identity provider and
verified by the security service. This section outlines the trusted data payloads that are subject
to such sign-and-verify procedures.</p>
<h3 id="client-definitions"><a class="header" href="#client-definitions">Client Definitions</a></h3>
<p>The system architecture requires each client application to have an identity that is unique and
stable. This requirement for stability is especially important given that many low-level
characteristics of a client application may change over time. Process identifiers, for example, can
change as a client application restarts. Even the contents of a client application image can change
due to an upgrade. So a client application needs to be able to present enough pieces of information
to the identity provider in order for the identify provider to make a binding decision about the
identity.</p>
<p>These pieces of information are collected together into what is called a <strong>client definition</strong>.</p>
<p>There can be no fixed set of properties that would make an adequate client definition in any
environment. The system architecture only requires that the orchestrator and the identity provider
are able to agree on what the client definition should be. Client definition is essentially a
contract between those two components. An example of a client definition might be a JSON document
containing properties such as the container image identifier, host identifier and kernel namespace.</p>
<p>Client definition formats are agreed between the orchestrator and the identity provider on any given
system. A JSON or similar structure would be typical. The client definition is constructed by the
orchestrator, and notified to the identity provider at key lifecycle points such as client start-up
or shut-down. (More details are given in the section on dataflows below).</p>
<p>Client definitions, regardless of their precise format and content, must be signed by the
orchestrator and verified upon receipt by the identity provider. The orchestrator will use its own
private key for signing, and verification will be via the shared public key. See the section above
on trust relationships for details of how these keys are generated and shared.</p>
<h3 id="client-proofs"><a class="header" href="#client-proofs">Client Proofs</a></h3>
<p>A client definition is essentially a set of claims. By presenting a client definition, the client
application is asserting its worthiness to be assigned a particular identity string by the identity
provider. In order for these claims to be made valid inputs to the mapping process, the identity
provider needs to be able to trust them. They cannot simply be asserted. They must also be
<strong>proved</strong>. Proofs are obtained through an attestation process, the precise details of which are
beyond the scope of this document, but illustrative examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply-chain proofs, such as an image signature or signatures on component binaries.</li>
<li>Host proofs, such as might be derived from a platform root-of-trust.</li>
<li>Runtime proofs, such as process identifiers, user/group identifiers, kernel namespaces or
application-specific key pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with client definitions, client proofs must be signed by the orchestrator and verified upon
receipt by the identity provider. The orchestrator will use its own private key for signing, and
verification will be via the shared public key. See the section above on trust relationships for
details of how these keys are generated and shared.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-1"><a class="header" href="#authentication-1">Authentication</a></h3>
<h4 id="authentication-tokens"><a class="header" href="#authentication-tokens">Authentication Tokens</a></h4>
<p>When client applications invoke API operations in the security service, they must include their
application identity string somehow. This allows the security service to provide the required level
of isolation amongst the multiple clients that might exist. Not only must the identity string be
specified, but it must be specified in a way that allows the security service to be sure that it is
genuine. Client applications do this by means of an <strong>authentication token</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="archive/../parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire protocol specification</strong></a> has an <strong>authentication
header</strong> field that is suited to this purpose. The protocol is very flexible, and the authentication
header can be used in a variety of ways. It would be entirely possible for the client application to
simply pass its application identity directly as a cleartext string. The security service would
support this (and it offers an authentication style known as <strong>direct authentication</strong> for this
purpose). This is simple, and works well in a demo or proof-of-concept environment. But it is not
suitable for a deployed system architecture, because it does not fulfill the stated design goal of
secretless communication.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is for the authentication header to contain a payload that not only
includes the application identity, but also proves cryptographically that it is from a valid client.
This payload takes the form of a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519"><strong>signed JSON Web Token
(JWT)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The application identity string will be carried as one of the JWT claim fields. (TODO: which one?)
Since the JWT will be signed, this allows the security service to verify that it is genuine, and
thus permit the call to go ahead with the required level of isolation.</p>
<p>JWT tokens are not directly signed by client applications, since client applications do not
participate in any of the trust relationships that this system architecture has defined. Instead,
they are signed by the identity provider, and passed back to the client application in order to
eventually be forwarded to (and verified by) the security service. The identity provider uses its
private key to sign the JWT. The security service has the public part of this key, and is hence able
to perform the verification. The identity provider and the security service share one of the trust
relationships that were defined above.</p>
<h4 id="unix-peer-credentials"><a class="header" href="#unix-peer-credentials">Unix Peer Credentials</a></h4>
<p>Another solution to the authentication problem is to use Unix peer credentials with the <a href="archive/../parsec_service/authenticators.html">Unix peer
credentials authenticator</a>. Unix peer credentials are
connection metadata which specify the effective Unix user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) of the
connecting process. When using a Unix domain sockets transport, the endpoints can get each other's
UID and GID via the operating system.</p>
<p>In Unix peer credential authentication, the connecting process self-declares its UID inside the
authentication header of the request. The Parsec service validates that the self-declared UID
matches the actual UID from the peer credentials. If they match, authentication was successful, and
the application identity is set to the stringified UID.</p>
<h2 id="block-architecture-summary"><a class="header" href="#block-architecture-summary">Block Architecture Summary</a></h2>
<p>Refer to the figure below for a block representation of the key architectural components.</p>
<p><img src="archive/diagrams/system_architecture.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" /></p>
<h2 id="flows"><a class="header" href="#flows">Flows</a></h2>
<h3 id="system-lifecycle-boot"><a class="header" href="#system-lifecycle-boot">System Lifecycle: Boot</a></h3>
<p>The following bootstrapping actions are needed in order to establish the trust relationships that
exist between the orchestrator and the identity provider, and between the identity provider and the
security service respectively. For more details, see the section above on trust relationships. The
bootstrapping flows require each component to generate a root key pair, to store the private key
part in process-local memory, and to share the public part (as an X509 certificate) with the
trusting component.</p>
<p>Public root certificates are shared using the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> API operation, with a flag to
indicate that this is a root certificate as opposed to an intermediate. Both the security service
and the identity provider support this operation via the respective (separate) wire protocol
endpoints.</p>
<p>Root certificates may be shared only once. The <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> operation is defined to fail if
it is called more than once with the root flag set.</p>
<h3 id="system-lifecycle-refresh"><a class="header" href="#system-lifecycle-refresh">System Lifecycle: Refresh</a></h3>
<p>Background flows occur on a periodic cadence while the system is active, and they are aimed at
maintaining the trust relationships between the orchestrator, identity provider and security
service.</p>
<p>Trust relationships require intermediate key pairs to be generated periodically in order to fulfil
the stated design objective around short-lived cryptography. The root key pairs generated in the
bootstrapping phase do not fulfill this objective by themselves.</p>
<p>Intermediate key pairs are generated by both the orchestrator and identity provider. Each component
stores its private key in local process memory, but needs to share the public key. As with the
bootstrapping flows, the orchestrator shares its public key with the identity provider, and the
identity provider shares its public key with the security service. There is a common API in the wire
protocol to support this operation.</p>
<p>Public intermediate certificates are shared using the <strong>ShareTrustBundle</strong> API operation, with a
flag to indicate that this is an intermediate certificate as opposed to a root. Both the security
service and the identity provider support this operation via the respective (separate) wire protocol
endpoints.</p>
<p>Intermediate public certificates may be shared any number of times. Any previous intermediate
certificate is immediately invalidated upon the event of a new intermediate being shared.</p>
<h3 id="application-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#application-lifecycle">Application Lifecycle</a></h3>
<p>Client application lifecycles are governed by the orchestrator. The orchestrator is responsible for
starting and stopping the client application containers or processes. It is also responsible for
notifying these events to the identity provider, and for sending the client definitions and client
proofs.</p>
<p>To add a new client definition to the identity provider, the orchestrator calls the <strong>AddClient</strong>
operation with a signed data payload containing the client definition properties (typically a JSON
document).</p>
<p>Having informed the identity provider of a new client definition, the next role of the orchestrator
is to run an attestation process to prove its validity. The results of the attestation process are
then sent to the identity provider using the <strong>ProveClient</strong> operation, again with a signed data
payload containing the proofs.</p>
<h3 id="general-usage-flows"><a class="header" href="#general-usage-flows">General Usage Flows</a></h3>
<p>The final flow to consider is the general use case of the client application making a call to the
security service to perform a cryptographic operation with isolation. This is obviously the most
commonly-occurring flow, and everything else in the system is geared towards enabling this
fundamental operation.</p>
<p>This flow begins with the client application, which consumes the security API via the client
library. Recall that client libraries exist for a variety of popular programming languages. Recall
also that each client library offers a highly-designed developer experience, with appropriate levels
of simplification and argument defaulting so that common cryptographic use cases are catered for
with a minimum of effort on the part of the application developer.</p>
<p>The client library is responsible for implementing the language-specific idioms in terms of one or
more wire protocol API calls to the security service. In order to make these calls, it needs a
signed JWT token that embeds the correct application identity for the client. These tokens come from
the identity provider. Hence the client library must first call the identity provider to obtain this
token. It can then call the security service with the signed token.</p>
<p>The security service is responsible for verifying the token and extracting the application identity
from it. This identity can then be used as a namespace for all secure assets that are stored for
that client.</p>
<p>Once the security service has verified and accepted a call to an API operation, it becomes the
responsibility of the back-end cryptographic provider to actually implement the call either in
software or hardware. Once the operation has been executed, the results can be marshalled back to
the client library, which can once again implement whatever simplifications or interpretations are
required to make them suitable for the application developer.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-diagram"><a class="header" href="#sequence-diagram">Sequence Diagram</a></h3>
<p>All flows are summarized and captured in the sequence diagram below. The diagram attempts to collect
together and summarize all of the flows that are needed for bootstrapping, background operations and
also general usage as described above. In order to strike the right balance between completeness and
simplicity, the flow diagram does not include every possible path. In particular, the actions taken
in response to errors or failed verifications are not captured here.</p>

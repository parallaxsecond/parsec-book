# Parsec Stability

The work for setting up a stability framework for Parsec was done for the 0.8.0 release, see the
[related issue](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-book/issues/83) for more details.

## Why is stability important?

Parsec is a long-running service that will be configured, deployed, upgraded and maintained over a
long period of time. The environment will also have client applications that are calling it, and
persistent state that is collected on storage. Components will be upgraded over time. For Parsec to
be supportable in enterprise system, it must not be brittle against upgrades. If Parsec is upgraded
and restarted, client applications should continue working, and all persistent state from prior
versions should remain valid and usable.

## What does stability mean for the Parsec service?

The following definition of stability is chosen for the Parsec service: *whatever two versions A and
B of the Parsec binary, B being newer than A, A and B are stable if A can be removed and replaced by
B without breaking anything*.

Note that we are not looking at stability in the reverse direction: B cannot be replaced by A
without breaking anything. The only exception is for the communication channel with clients where
any version of the client library can successfully communicate with any version of the service.

The principle of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used to describe the stability of
Parsec versions and when breaking changes are done. If `parsec` version is at `1.3.0` then all
future stable version to that will be `1.x.y`. Note that, although semver is used to describe Parsec
stability, it is a strong goal for Parsec to remain stable at a `1.x.y` version. This document
introduces the efforts that are made so that a `MAJOR` version bump should hopefully never happen.

## What needs to be stable?

With the above definition, Parsec stays stable if it keeps the exact same communication channels and
format with its environment. Those are already described in the [dataflow
diagram](../parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.md#dataflow-diagram) in the threat
model.

The communication channels that need to be stable are (some of them are not in the diagram):

1. Communication with clients
   1. Definition of requests/responses (their format)
   2. Definition of operation contracts (their intended behavior)
   3. Definition of Listeners endpoints (how to contact Parsec)
2. Communication with authenticators
3. Communication received from the CLI invocation
4. Configuration file (including default configuration options)
5. Persistent data stored internally
   1. Key mappings
6. OS signals
7. systemd communication
8. Dynamic libraries dependencies
9. Environment variables
10. Hardware backends
11. Build toolchain

Those will be described as "stability requirement" in the remainder of this document. As new
features are added to the codebase, new stability requirements might appear. Those should be added
to the list above and looked in detail below.

## Stability Review

Let's look at each of the points above and check:

- what stability exactly means
- how stability is ensured
- how stability is tested

### Dynamic libraries

We use the specific versions of those dynamic libraries and test it on CI:

- PKCS#11 version 2.40
- libclang version 6.0
- TSS libraries version 2.3.3
- CryptoAuthLib version 3.1.0 (not tested on CI, as there is no software mock available)

Mbed Crypto is currently compiled from scratch. When a new LTS version of Mbed TLS ships a PSA
Crypto compliant version of Mbed Crypto, stability guarantees will be made on that version.

The Trusted Service provider is currently built using a pre-release version of the Trusted Services
library. We aim to keep the Parsec service aligned with recent revisions of the TS code, however
since no release has been made, no guarantees can be offered about stability. At the time of
writing, no platform is officially supported for Trusted Services deployments.
